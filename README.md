![oreboot logo](Documentation/img/logo-small.png)

oreboot is a downstream fork of coreboot, i.e. oreboot is coreboot without 'c'.

oreboot is mostly written in Rust, with assembly where needed.

oreboot currently only plans to support LinuxBoot payloads.

## Rust Embedded

![Rust Embedded Working Group Logo](Documentation/img/rust-embedded-logo.png)

We build on top of the abstractions from the [Rust Embedded Working Group](https://github.com/rust-embedded)'s model with its crates and traits, detailed
in [their book](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/book/portability/index.html).

In a nutshell: ![Rust Embedded Model](Documentation/img/rust-embedded-model.png)

## Vendor support

SoC vendors are expected to provide documentation to their cores, peripherals
and other blocks and/or their SVD files, so that we can generate the PAC and HAL
crates, or ideally, the vendor should _provide and maintain_ those as well.

The Rust Embedded book offers [design patterns and implementation guidelines](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/book/design-patterns/hal/index.html) as well as
a [glossary](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/book/appendix/glossary.html) to gain
an understanding of the structure.

## Boot Flow and Setup

To get a general understanding of how oreboot and firmware in general works,
have a look at the [boot flow documentation](Documentation/boot-flow.md). It
describes how firmware is stored and boots up on a platform / SoC.

## Dilemma of drivers

Note that oreboot does not aim to turn into its own operating system.
Accordingly, we intend to keep the amount and functionality of drivers low.
However, by design of SoCs, we do have to implement something to load code:

- SPI flash, SD cards and eMMC are rather simple to load from, but require
  special mechanisms and tools to write to the storage part
- USB and ethernet are more flexible for development as they allow for loading
  code from another machine, but are more complex to implement
- UART is simple for data transfer, but very slow for larger payloads, such as
  a Linux kernel

In many cases, no full driver is needed, since we only need to e.g. read from
storage, and we need no rich file systems. To avoid colliding with the needs and
specifics of an OS, we recommend clearly separating storage parts holding the
firmware and operating system, respectively. For example, put the firmware in a
SPI flash and the OS on an NVMe SSD.

## Getting oreboot

Clone this repo and enter its directory, i.e.:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/oreboot/oreboot.git
cd oreboot
```

## Prerequisites

In general, you will need the following packages installed:

- `device-tree-compiler`
- `pkg-config`
- `libssl`
- `rustup`

For Debian based systems, there is a make target to install those, which pulls
`rustup` through curl from https://sh.rustup.rs:

```sh
make debiansysprepare
```

Otherwise, install the package through your system package manager.

## Setting up the toolchain

Regardless of your OS, you will need to install the toolchain for oreboot.
This command only needs to be done once but it is safe to do it repeatedly.

```sh
make firsttime
```

## Keeping build tools up to date

Each time you start to work with oreboot, or even daily:

```sh
cd oreboot
make update
```

You should definitely do this before reporting any issues.

## Developing oreboot

There are two different things in the project:

1. `src/mainboards/*` the actual targets; those depend on and share crates, which
   can be drivers, SoC init code, and similar. For mainboards, `Cargo.lock`
   **must** be tracked.
2. `src/*` everything else; these are the aforementioned crates, for which, we
   do not track the `Cargo.lock` files.

Checking in a mainboard's `Cargo.lock` file records the state of its dependencies
at the time of a successful build, enabling reproducibility. Ideally, a lock file
is updated follwoing successful boot on hardware.

For more, see: https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/faq.html#why-do-binaries-have-cargolock-in-version-control-but-not-libraries

When creating a new mainboard, looking at how others are set up for the same
architecture is a good start. Be aware that oreboot is targeting bare metal, so
there is no standard library available.

## Building oreboot

To build oreboot for a specific platform, do this:

```
# Go to the mainboard's directory
cd src/mainboard/sunxi/nezha
# Build the mainboard target
make mainboard
# View disassembly
make objdump
# Run from RAM without flashing
make run
# Flash to the board
make flash
```

The root `Makefile` allows you to quickly build all platforms:

```
# build all mainboards
make mainboards
# build everything in parallel
make -j mainboards
```

## QEMU

```
# Install QEMU for your target platform, e.g. x86
sudo apt install qemu-system-x86

# Build release build and start with QEMU
cd src/mainboard/emulation/qemu-q35 && make run
# Quit qemu with CTRL-A X
```

To build QEMU from source for RISC-V:

```
git clone https://github.com/qemu/qemu && cd qemu
mkdir build-riscv64 && cd build-riscv64
../configure --target-list=riscv64-softmmu
make -j$(nproc)
# QEMU binary is at riscv64-softmmu/qemu-system-riscv64
```

To build QEMU from source for aarch64:

```
git clone https://github.com/qemu/qemu && cd qemu
mkdir build-aarch64 && cd build-aarch64
../configure --target-list=aarch64-softmmu
make -j$(nproc)
# QEMU binary is at aarch64-softmmu/qemu-system-aarch64
```

## Mainboards

Similar to coreboot, the structure in oreboot is per vendor and mainboard.
Multiple architectures and SoCs are supported respectively, and their common
code is shared between the boards. Boards may have variants if minor deviations
would otherwise cause too much code duplication.

### Emulation

- `qemu-riscv`

### Hardware

#### RISC-V

##### Allwinner D1 SoC

- Sipeed Lichee RV Dock / Dock Pro
- MangoPi MQ-Pro
- DongshanPi Nezha STU
- Allwinner Nezha

### Previous Implementations

For reference, [earlier approaches are documented](graveyard.md). Have a look at
those for x86 and Arm platforms and mainboards.

### Parked for Revival

Earlier emulation targets have been parked in `src.broken/mainboard/emulation/`.
They are supposed to provide a general understanding of each architecture that
oreboot seeks to support:

- `qemu-armv7`
- `qemu-aarch64`
- `qemu-q35`

## Ground Rules

- `Makefile`s must be simple. Use `xtask` instead for control flow, e.g., adding
  headers or checksums to the binaries, sitchting images, etc..
- `Cargo.toml` in the respective `src/mainboard/$VENDOR/$BOARD` (sub)directories
  allow for board-specific dependencies and building all stages in parallel.
- All code and markup is auto-formatted with `make format` with no exceptions.
  A CI check will tell if a change does not adhere to the formatting rules.
- There will be no code written in C. We write all code in Rust.
- We will not run our own Gerrit. We are using GitHub for now, and the GitHub
  Pull Request review mechanism.
- We will not run our own Jenkins. We will use the most appropriate CI; for
  now, that is GitHub, but we will be flexible.
