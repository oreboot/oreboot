// Zen starts with the bootblock in RAM, at an address not easily known
// to code, with a pretend segment of f000, and a pretend IP of fff0.
// Traditionally one has a jmp cs:ip instruction at said boot block;
// you can't do that because you're actually running in bigreal with
// a shadow CS set to 0x76000000 in one case.

// This is now designed to be standalone 16-bit blob, written to assume
// CS is 0xf0000, and it starts at the top 4K of "flash".
// It then jumps to 8:760000 using the classic push and ret.
// Due to the 4k alignment, we just eat the whole last page.

/* Start code to put an i386 or later processor into 32-bit protected mode.
