// Zen starts with the bootblock in RAM, at an address not easily known
// to code, with a pretend segment of f000, and a pretend IP of fff0.
// Traditionally one has a jmp cs:ip instruction at said boot block;
// you can't do that because you're actually running in bigreal with
// a shadow CS set to 0x76000000 in one case.

// This is now designed to be standalone 16-bit blob, written to assume
// CS is 0xf0000, and it starts at the top 4K of "flash".
// It then jumps to 8:760000 using the classic push and ret.
// Due to the 4k alignment, we just eat the whole last page.
// This makes things easier: we can just place tables at .org 0x800,
// code at 0, and avoid coreboot's strenuous bootloader and gas games.

	/* Note: gas handles memory addresses in 16 bit code very poorly.
	 * In particular it doesn't appear to have a directive allowing you
	 * associate a section or even an absolute offset with a segment register.
	 *
	 * This means that anything except cs:ip relative offsets are
	 * a real pain in 16 bit mode.  And explains why it is almost
	 * impossible to get gas to do lgdt correctly.
	 *
	 * One way to work around this is to have the linker do the
	 * math instead of the assembler.  This solves the very
	 * practical problem of being able to write code that can
	 * be relocated.
	 *
	 * An lgdt call before we have memory enabled cannot be
	 * position independent, as we cannot execute a call
	 * instruction to get our current instruction pointer.
	 * So while this code is relocatable it isn't arbitrarily
	 * relocatable.
	 *
	 * The criteria for relocation have been relaxed to their
	 * utmost, so that we can use the same code for both
	 * our initial entry point and startup of the second CPU.
	 * The code assumes when executing at _start16bit that:
	 * (((cs & 0xfff) == 0) and (ip == _start16bit & 0xffff))
	 * or
	 * ((cs == anything) and (ip == 0)).
	 *
	 * The restrictions in reset16.inc mean that _start16bit initially
	 * must be loaded at or above 0xffff0000 or below 0x100000.
	 *
	 * The linker scripts computes gdtptr16_offset by simply returning
	 * the low 16 bits.  This means that the initial segment used
	 * when start is called must be 64K aligned.  This should not
	 * restrict the address as the ip address can be anything.
	 *
	 * Also load an IDT with NULL limit to prevent the 16bit IDT being used
	 * in protected mode before c_start.S sets up a 32bit IDT when entering
	 * RAM stage. In practise: CPU will shutdown on any exception.
	 * See IA32 manual Vol 3A 19.26 Interrupts.
