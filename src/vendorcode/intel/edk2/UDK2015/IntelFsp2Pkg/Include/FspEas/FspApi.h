/**
  This FSP API is called soon after coming out of reset and before memory and stack is
  available. This FSP API will load the microcode update, enable code caching for the
  region specified by the boot loader and also setup a temporary stack to be used until
  main memory is initialized.

  A hardcoded stack can be set up with the following values, and the "esp" register
  initialized to point to this hardcoded stack.
  1. The return address where the FSP will return control after setting up a temporary
     stack.
  2. A pointer to the input parameter structure

  However, since the stack is in ROM and not writeable, this FSP API cannot be called
  using the "call" instruction, but needs to be jumped to.

  @param[in] FsptUpdDataPtr     Pointer to the FSPT_UPD data structure.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS           Temporary RAM was initialized successfully.
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER Input parameters are invalid.
  @retval EFI_UNSUPPORTED       The FSP calling conditions were not met.
  @retval EFI_DEVICE_ERROR      Temp RAM initialization failed.

  If this function is successful, the FSP initializes the ECX and EDX registers to point to
  a temporary but writeable memory range available to the boot loader and returns with
  FSP_SUCCESS in register EAX. Register ECX points to the start of this temporary
  memory range and EDX points to the end of the range. Boot loader is free to use the
  whole range described. Typically the boot loader can reload the ESP register to point
  to the end of this returned range so that it can be used as a standard stack.

  After FspMemInit completes its execution, it passes the pointer to the HobList and
  returns to the boot loader from where it was called. BootLoader is responsible to
  migrate it's stack and data to Memory.

  complete the silicon initialization and provides bootloader an opportunity to get
