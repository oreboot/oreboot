  UEFI Platform to Driver Configuration Protocol is defined in UEFI specification.

  This is a protocol that is optionally produced by the platform and optionally consumed
  by a UEFI Driver in its Start() function. This protocol allows the driver to receive
  configuration information as part of being started.

/**
  The UEFI driver must call Query early in the Start() function
  before any time consuming operations are performed. If
  ChildHandle is NULL the driver is requesting information from
  the platform about the ControllerHandle that is being started.
  Information returned from Query may lead to the drivers Start()
  function failing.
  If the UEFI driver is a bus driver and producing a ChildHandle,
  the driver must call Query after the child handle has been created
  and an EFI_DEVICE_PATH_PROTOCOL has been placed on that handle,
  but before any time consuming operation is performed. If information
  return by Query may lead the driver to decide to not create the
  ChildHandle. The driver must then cleanup and remove the ChildHandle
  from the system.
  The UEFI driver repeatedly calls Query, processes the information
  returned by the platform, and calls Response passing in the
  arguments returned from Query. The Instance value passed into
  Response must be the same value passed into the corresponding
  call to Query. The UEFI driver must continuously call Query and
  Response until EFI_NOT_FOUND is returned by Query.
  If the UEFI driver does not recognize the ParameterTypeGuid, it
  calls Response with a ConfigurationAction of
  EfiPlatformConfigurationActionUnsupportedGuid. The UEFI driver
  must then continue calling Query and Response until EFI_NOT_FOUND
  is returned by Query. This gives the platform an opportunity to
  pass additional configuration settings using a different
  ParameterTypeGuid that may be supported by the driver.
  An Instance value of zero means return the first ParameterBlock
  in the set of unprocessed parameter blocks. The driver should
  increment the Instance value by one for each successive call to Query.

  @param This                 A pointer to the EFI_PLATFORM_TO_DRIVER_CONFIGURATION_PROTOCOL instance.

  @param ControllerHandle     The handle the platform will return
                              configuration information about.

  @param ChildHandle          The handle of the child controller to
                              return information on. This is an optional
                              parameter that may be NULL. It will be
                              NULL for device drivers and for bus
                              drivers that attempt to get options for
                              the bus controller. It will not be NULL
                              for a bus driver that attempts to get
                              options for one of its child controllers.


  @param Instance             Pointer to the Instance value. Zero means
                              return the first query data. The caller should
                              increment this value by one each time to retrieve
                              successive data.

  @param ParameterTypeGuid    An EFI_GUID that defines the contents
                              of ParameterBlock. UEFI drivers must
                              use the ParameterTypeGuid to determine
                              how to parse the ParameterBlock. The caller
                              should not attempt to free ParameterTypeGuid.

  @param ParameterBlock       The platform returns a pointer to the
                              ParameterBlock structure which
                              contains details about the
                              configuration parameters specific to
                              the ParameterTypeGuid. This structure
                              is defined based on the protocol and
                              may be different for different
                              protocols. UEFI driver decodes this
                              structure and its contents based on
                              ParameterTypeGuid. ParameterBlock is
                              allocated by the platform and the
                              platform is responsible for freeing
                              the ParameterBlock after Result is
                              called.

  @param ParameterBlockSize   The platform returns the size of
                              the ParameterBlock in bytes.


  @retval EFI_SUCCESS           The platform return parameter
                                information for ControllerHandle.

  @retval EFI_NOT_FOUND         No more unread Instance exists.

  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER ControllerHandle is NULL.

  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER Instance is NULL.

  @retval EFI_DEVICE_ERROR      A device error occurred while
                                attempting to return parameter block
                                information for the controller
                                specified by ControllerHandle and
                                ChildHandle.

  @retval EFI_OUT_RESOURCES     There are not enough resources
                                available to set the configuration
                                options for the controller specified
                                by ControllerHandle and ChildHandle.
