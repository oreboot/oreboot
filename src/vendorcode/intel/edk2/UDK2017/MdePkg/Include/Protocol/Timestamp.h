/**
  Retrieves the current value of a 64-bit free running timestamp counter.

  The counter shall count up in proportion to the amount of time that has passed. The counter value
  will always roll over to zero. The properties of the counter can be retrieved from GetProperties().
  The caller should be prepared for the function to return the same value twice across successive calls.
  The counter value will not go backwards other than when wrapping, as defined by EndValue in GetProperties().
  The frequency of the returned timestamp counter value must remain constant. Power management operations that
  affect clocking must not change the returned counter frequency. The quantization of counter value updates may
  vary as long as the value reflecting time passed remains consistent.

  @param  None.

  @retval The current value of the free running timestamp counter.
