/**

  This function renders an image as a bitmap or to the screen and
  can clip the image. The bitmap is either supplied by the caller
  or else is allocated by the function. The images can be drawn
  transparently or opaquely. If EFI_HII_DRAW_FLAG_CLIP is set,

  This function renders an image to a bitmap or the screen using
  the specified color and options. It draws the image on an
  existing bitmap, allocates a new bitmap or uses the screen. The
  images can be clipped. If EFI_HII_DRAW_FLAG_CLIP is set, then
  all pixels drawn outside the bounding box specified by Width and
  Height are ignored. The EFI_HII_DRAW_FLAG_TRANSPARENT flag
  determines whether the image will be drawn transparent or
  opaque. If EFI_HII_DRAW_FLAG_FORCE_TRANS is set, then the image
  will be drawn so that all 'off' pixels in the image will
  be drawn using the pixel value from Blt and all other pixels
  will be copied. If EFI_HII_DRAW_FLAG_FORCE_OPAQUE is set, then
  the image's pixels will be copied directly to the
  destination. If EFI_HII_DRAW_FLAG_DEFAULT is set, then the image
  will be drawn transparently or opaque, depending on the
  image's transparency setting (see EFI_IMAGE_TRANSPARENT).
  Images cannot be drawn transparently if Blt is NULL. If
  EFI_HII_DIRECT_TO_SCREEN is set, then the image will be written
  directly to the output device specified by Screen. Otherwise the
