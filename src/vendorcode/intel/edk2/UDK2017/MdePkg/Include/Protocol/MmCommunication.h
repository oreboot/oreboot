  Communicates with a registered handler.

  This function provides a service to send and receive messages from a registered UEFI service.

  @param[in] This                The EFI_MM_COMMUNICATION_PROTOCOL instance.
  @param[in] CommBuffer          A pointer to the buffer to convey into MMRAM.
  @param[in] CommSize            The size of the data buffer being passed in. On exit, the size of data
                                 being returned. Zero if the handler does not wish to reply with any data.
                                 This parameter is optional and may be NULL.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS            The message was successfully posted.
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER  The CommBuffer was NULL.
  @retval EFI_BAD_BUFFER_SIZE    The buffer is too large for the MM implementation.
                                 If this error is returned, the MessageLength field
                                 in the CommBuffer header or the integer pointed by
                                 CommSize, are updated to reflect the maximum payload
                                 size the implementation can accommodate.
  @retval EFI_ACCESS_DENIED      The CommunicateBuffer parameter or CommSize parameter,
                                 if not omitted, are in address range that cannot be
                                 accessed by the MM environment.
