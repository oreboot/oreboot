  EFI IPSEC Protocol Definition
  The EFI_IPSEC_PROTOCOL is used to abstract the ability to deal with the individual
  packets sent and received by the host and provide packet-level security for IP
  datagram.
  The EFI_IPSEC2_PROTOCOL is used to abstract the ability to deal with the individual
  packets sent and received by the host and provide packet-level security for IP
  datagram. In addition, it supports the Option (extension header) processing in
  IPsec which doesn't support in EFI_IPSEC_PROTOCOL. It is also recommended to
  use EFI_IPSEC2_PROTOCOL instead of EFI_IPSEC_PROTOCOL especially for IPsec Tunnel
  Mode.

  Handles IPsec processing for both inbound and outbound IP packets. Compare with
  Process() in EFI_IPSEC_PROTOCOL, this interface has the capability to process
  Option(Extension Header).

  The EFI_IPSEC2_PROCESS process routine handles each inbound or outbound packet.
  The behavior is that it can perform one of the following actions:
  bypass the packet, discard the packet, or protect the packet.

  @param[in]       This               Pointer to the EFI_IPSEC2_PROTOCOL instance.

  @param[in, out]  IpHead             Pointer to the IP Header it is either
                                      the EFI_IP4_HEADER or EFI_IP6_HEADER.
                                      On input, it contains the IP header.
                                      On output, 1) in tunnel mode and the
                                      traffic direction is inbound, the buffer
                                      will be reset to zero by IPsec; 2) in
                                      tunnel mode and the traffic direction
                                      is outbound, the buffer will reset to
                                      be the tunnel IP header.3) in transport
                                      mode, the related fielders (like payload
                                      length, Next header) in IP header will
                                      be modified according to the condition.
  @param[in, out]  LastHead           For IP4, it is the next protocol in IP
                                      header. For IP6 it is the Next Header
                                      of the last extension header.
  @param[in, out]  OptionsBuffer      On input, it contains the options
                                      (extensions header) to be processed by
                                      IPsec. On output, 1) in tunnel mode and
                                      the traffic direction is outbound, it
                                      will be set to NULL, and that means this
                                      contents was wrapped after inner header
                                      and should not be concatenated after
                                      tunnel header again; 2) in transport
                                      mode and the traffic direction is inbound,
                                      if there are IP options (extension headers)
                                      protected by IPsec, IPsec will concatenate
                                      the those options after the input options
                                      (extension headers); 3) on other situations,
                                      the output of contents of OptionsBuffer
                                      might be same with input's. The caller
                                      should take the responsibility to free
                                      the buffer both on input and on output.
  @param[in, out]  OptionsLength      On input, the input length of the options
                                      buffer. On output, the output length of
                                      the options buffer.
  @param[in, out]  FragmentTable      Pointer to a list of fragments. On input,
                                      these fragments contain the IP payload.
                                      On output, 1) in tunnel mode and the traffic
                                      direction is inbound, the fragments contain
                                      the whole IP payload which is from the
                                      IP inner header to the last byte of the
                                      packet; 2) in tunnel mode and the traffic
                                      direction is the outbound, the fragments
                                      contains the whole encapsulated payload
                                      which encapsulates the whole IP payload
                                      between the encapsulated header and
                                      encapsulated trailer fields. 3) in transport
                                      mode and the traffic direction is inbound,
                                      the fragments contains the IP payload
                                      which is from the next layer protocol to
                                      the last byte of the packet; 4) in transport
                                      mode and the traffic direction is outbound,
                                      the fragments contains the whole encapsulated
                                      payload which encapsulates the next layer
                                      protocol information between the encapsulated
                                      header and encapsulated trailer fields.
  @param[in, out]  FragmentCount      Number of fragments.
  @param[in]       TrafficDirection   Traffic direction.
  @param[out]      RecycleSignal      Event for recycling of resources.

  @retval      EFI_SUCCESS           The packet was processed by IPsec successfully.
  @retval      EFI_ACCESS_DENIED     The packet was discarded.
  @retval      EFI_NOT_READY         The IKE negotiation is invoked and the packet
                                     was discarded.
  @retval      EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER One or more of following are TRUE:
                                     If OptionsBuffer is NULL;
                                     If OptionsLength is NULL;
                                     If FragmentTable is NULL;
                                     If FragmentCount is NULL.
