  This function renders a string to a bitmap or the screen using
  the specified font, color and options. It either draws the
  string and glyphs on an existing bitmap, allocates a new bitmap,
  or uses the screen. The strings can be clipped or wrapped.
  Optionally, the function also returns the information about each
  row and the character position on that row. If
  EFI_HII_OUT_FLAG_CLIP is set, then text will be formatted only
  based on explicit line breaks and all pixels which would lie
  outside the bounding box specified by Width and Height are
  ignored. The information in the RowInfoArray only describes
  characters which are at least partially displayed. For the final
  row, the LineHeight and BaseLine may describe pixels that are
  outside the limit specified by Height (unless
  EFI_HII_OUT_FLAG_CLIP_CLEAN_Y is specified) even though those
  pixels were not drawn. The LineWidth may describe pixels which
  are outside the limit specified by Width (unless
  EFI_HII_OUT_FLAG_CLIP_CLEAN_X is specified) even though those
  pixels were not drawn. If EFI_HII_OUT_FLAG_CLIP_CLEAN_X is set,
  then it modifies the behavior of EFI_HII_OUT_FLAG_CLIP so that
  if a character's right-most on pixel cannot fit, then it will
  not be drawn at all. This flag requires that
  EFI_HII_OUT_FLAG_CLIP be set. If EFI_HII_OUT_FLAG_CLIP_CLEAN_Y
  is set, then it modifies the behavior of EFI_HII_OUT_FLAG_CLIP
  so that if a row's bottom-most pixel cannot fit, then it will
  not be drawn at all. This flag requires that
  EFI_HII_OUT_FLAG_CLIP be set. If EFI_HII_OUT_FLAG_WRAP is set,
  then text will be wrapped at the right-most line-break
  opportunity prior to a character whose right-most extent would
  exceed Width. If no line-break opportunity can be found, then
  the text will behave as if EFI_HII_OUT_FLAG_CLIP_CLEAN_X is set.
  This flag cannot be used with EFI_HII_OUT_FLAG_CLIP_CLEAN_X. If
  EFI_HII_OUT_FLAG_TRANSPARENT is set, then BackgroundColor is
  ignored and all 'off' pixels in the character's drawn
  will use the pixel value from Blt. This flag cannot be used if
  Blt is NULL upon entry. If EFI_HII_IGNORE_IF_NO_GLYPH is set,
  then characters which have no glyphs are not drawn. Otherwise,
  they are replaced with Unicode character code 0xFFFD (REPLACEMENT
  CHARACTER). If EFI_HII_IGNORE_LINE_BREAK is set, then explicit
  line break characters will be ignored. If
  EFI_HII_DIRECT_TO_SCREEN is set, then the string will be written
  directly to the output device specified by Screen. Otherwise the
  string will be rendered to the bitmap specified by Bitmap.

  @param This             A pointer to the EFI_HII_FONT_PROTOCOL instance.

  @param Flags            Describes how the string is to be drawn.

                          the string will be output in the default
                          system font and color.

  @param Blt              If this points to a non-NULL on entry, this points
                          to the image, which is Width pixels wide and
                          Height pixels high. The string will be drawn onto
                          this image and EFI_HII_OUT_FLAG_CLIP is implied.
                          If this points to a NULL on entry, then a buffer
                          will be allocated to hold the generated image and

                          responsibility to free this buffer.

  @param BltX, BltY       Specifies the offset from the left and top
                          edge of the image of the first character
                          cell in the image.

                          the number of elements. This array describes
                          the characters that were at least partially
                          drawn and the heights of the rows. It is the
                          caller's responsibility to free this buffer.

  @param RowInfoArraySize If this is non-NULL on entry, then on
                          exit it contains the number of
                          elements in RowInfoArray.

  @param ColumnInfoArray  If this is non-NULL, then on return it
                          will be filled with the horizontal
                          offset for each character in the
                          string on the row where it is
                          displayed. Non-printing characters
                          will have the offset ~0. The caller is

                          enough so that there is one entry for

                          including the null-terminator. It is

                          normalized that some character cells
                          overlap.

  This function renders a string as a bitmap or to the screen

  @param StringId   The string's id, which is unique within
                    PackageList.

  @param Language   Points to the language for the retrieved
                    string. If NULL, then the current system
                    language is used.

  @param StringInfo Points to the string output information,
                    including the color and font. If NULL, then
                    the string will be output in the default
                    system font and color.
