  EFI_USB2_HC_PROTOCOL as defined in UEFI 2.0.
  The USB Host Controller Protocol is used by code, typically USB bus drivers,
  running in the EFI boot services environment, to perform data transactions over
  a USB bus. In addition, it provides an abstraction for the root hub of the USB bus.

/**
  Submits isochronous transfer to an isochronous endpoint of a USB device.

  This function is used to submit isochronous transfer to a target endpoint of a USB device.
  The target endpoint is specified by DeviceAddressand EndpointAddress. Isochronous transfers are
  used when working with isochronous date. It provides periodic, continuous communication between
  the host and a device. Isochronous transfers can beused only by full-speed, high-speed, and
  super-speed devices.

  High-speed isochronous transfers can be performed using multiple data buffers. The number of
  buffers that are actually prepared for the transfer is specified by DataBuffersNumber. For
  full-speed isochronous transfers this value is ignored.

  Data represents a list of pointers to the data buffers. For full-speed isochronous transfers
  only the data pointed by Data[0]shall be used. For high-speed isochronous transfers and for
  the split transactions depending on DataLengththere several data buffers canbe used. For the
  high-speed isochronous transfers the total number of buffers must not exceed EFI_USB_MAX_ISO_BUFFER_NUM.

  For split transactions performed on full-speed device by high-speed host controller the total
  number of buffers is limited to EFI_USB_MAX_ISO_BUFFER_NUM1.
  If the isochronous transfer is successful, then EFI_SUCCESSis returned. The isochronous transfer
  is designed to be completed within one USB frame time, if it cannot be completed, EFI_TIMEOUT
  is returned. If an error other than timeout occurs during the USB transfer, then EFI_DEVICE_ERROR
  is returned and the detailed status code will be returned in TransferResult.

  EFI_INVALID_PARAMETERis returned if one of the following conditionsis satisfied:
    - Data is NULL.
    - DataLength is 0.
    - DeviceSpeed is not one of the supported values listed above.
    - MaximumPacketLength is invalid. MaximumPacketLength must be 1023 or less for full-speed devices,
      and 1024 or less for high-speed and super-speed devices.
    - TransferResult is NULL.

  @param  This                  A pointer to the EFI_USB2_HC_PROTOCOL instance.
  @param  DeviceAddress         Represents the address of the target device on the USB.
  @param  EndPointAddress       The combination of an endpoint number and an endpoint direction of the
                                target USB device.
  @param  DeviceSpeed           Indicates device speed. The supported values are EFI_USB_SPEED_FULL,
                                EFI_USB_SPEED_HIGH, or EFI_USB_SPEED_SUPER.
  @param  MaximumPacketLength   Indicates the maximum packet size the target endpoint is capable of
                                sending or receiving.

  @param  Data                  Array of pointers to the buffers of data that will be transmitted to USB
                                device or received from USB device.
  @param  DataLength            Specifies the length, in bytes, of the data to be sent to or received from
                                the USB device.
  @param  Translator            A pointer to the transaction translator data.
