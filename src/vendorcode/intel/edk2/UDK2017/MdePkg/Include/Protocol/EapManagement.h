  EFI EAP Management Protocol Definition
  The EFI EAP Management Protocol is designed to provide ease of management and
  ease of test for EAPOL state machine. It is intended for the supplicant side.
  It conforms to IEEE 802.1x specification.
  The definitions in this file are defined in UEFI Specification 2.2, which have
  not been verified by one implementation yet.
