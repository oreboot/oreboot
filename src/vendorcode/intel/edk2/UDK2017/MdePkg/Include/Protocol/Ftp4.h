  EFI FTPv4 (File Transfer Protocol version 4) Protocol Definition
  The EFI FTPv4 Protocol is used to locate communication devices that are
  supported by an EFI FTPv4 Protocol driver and to create and destroy instances
  of the EFI FTPv4 Protocol child protocol driver that can use the underlying
  communication device.
  The definitions in this file are defined in UEFI Specification 2.3, which have
  not been verified by one implementation yet.

  Polls for incoming data packets and processes outgoing data packets.

  The Poll() function can be used by network drivers and applications to increase the
  rate that data packets are moved between the communications device and the transmit
  and receive queues. In some systems, the periodic timer event in the managed network
  driver may not poll the underlying communications device fast enough to transmit
  and/or receive all data packets without missing incoming packets or dropping outgoing
  packets. Drivers and applications that are experiencing packet loss should try calling
  the Poll() function more often.

  @param[in] This                Pointer to the EFI_FTP4_PROTOCOL instance.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS            Incoming or outgoing data was processed.

  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER  This is NULL.
