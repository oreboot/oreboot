/**
  Starts running the configuration policy for the EFI IPv4 Protocol driver.

  The Start() function is called to determine and to begin the platform
  configuration policy by the EFI IPv4 Protocol driver. This determination may
  be as simple as returning EFI_UNSUPPORTED if there is no EFI IPv4 Protocol
  driver configuration policy. It may be as involved as loading some defaults
  from nonvolatile storage, downloading dynamic data from a DHCP server, and
  checking permissions with a site policy server.
  Starting the configuration policy is just the beginning. It may finish almost
  instantly or it may take several minutes before it fails to retrieve configuration
  information from one or more servers. Once the policy is started, drivers
  should use the DoneEvent parameter to determine when the configuration policy
  has completed. EFI_IP4_CONFIG_PROTOCOL.GetData() must then be called to
  determine if the configuration succeeded or failed.
  Until the configuration completes successfully, EFI IPv4 Protocol driver instances
  that are attempting to use default configurations must return EFI_NO_MAPPING.
  Once the configuration is complete, the EFI IPv4 Configuration Protocol driver
  signals DoneEvent. The configuration may need to be updated in the future.
  Note that in this case the EFI IPv4 Configuration Protocol driver must signal
  ReconfigEvent, and all EFI IPv4 Protocol driver instances that are using default
  configurations must return EFI_NO_MAPPING until the configuration policy has
  been rerun.

  @param  This                   The pointer to the EFI_IP4_CONFIG_PROTOCOL instance.
  @param  DoneEvent              Event that will be signaled when the EFI IPv4
                                 Protocol driver configuration policy completes
                                 execution. This event must be of type EVT_NOTIFY_SIGNAL.
  @param  ReconfigEvent          Event that will be signaled when the EFI IPv4
                                 Protocol driver configuration needs to be updated.
                                 This event must be of type EVT_NOTIFY_SIGNAL.
