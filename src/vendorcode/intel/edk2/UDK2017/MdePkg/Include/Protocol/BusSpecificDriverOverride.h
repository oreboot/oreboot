/** @file
  Bus Specific Driver Override protocol as defined in the UEFI 2.0 specification.

  Bus drivers that have a bus specific algorithm for matching drivers to controllers are
  required to produce this protocol for each controller. For example, a PCI Bus Driver will produce an
  instance of this protocol for every PCI controller that has a PCI option ROM that contains one or
  more UEFI drivers. The protocol instance is attached to the handle of the PCI controller.

  Uses a bus specific algorithm to retrieve a driver image handle for a controller.

                                OVERRIDE_PROTOCOL instance.
  @param  DriverImageHandle     On input, a pointer to the previous driver image handle returned
                                by GetDriver(). On output, a pointer to the next driver
                                image handle. Passing in a NULL, will return the first driver
                                image handle.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS           A bus specific override driver is returned in DriverImageHandle.

                                A bus specific override driver is not returned in DriverImageHandle.
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER DriverImageHandle is not a handle that was returned on a
                                previous call to GetDriver().
