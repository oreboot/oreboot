  Callback routine.

  EFI_DHCP4_CALLBACK is provided by the consumer of the EFI DHCPv4 Protocol driver
  to intercept events that occurred in the configuration process. This structure
  provides advanced control of each state transition of the DHCP process. The
  returned status code determines the behavior of the EFI DHCPv4 Protocol driver.
  There are three possible returned values, which are described in the following
  table.

  @param  This                  The pointer to the EFI DHCPv4 Protocol instance that is used to
                                configure this callback function.
  @param  Context               The pointer to the context that is initialized by
                                EFI_DHCP4_PROTOCOL.Configure().
  @param  CurrentState          The current operational state of the EFI DHCPv4 Protocol
                                driver.
  @param  Dhcp4Event            The event that occurs in the current state, which usually means a
                                state transition.
  @param  Packet                The DHCP packet that is going to be sent or already received.
  @param  NewPacket             The packet that is used to replace the above Packet.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS           Tells the EFI DHCPv4 Protocol driver to continue the DHCP process.
                                When it is in the Dhcp4Selecting state, it tells the EFI DHCPv4 Protocol
                                driver to stop collecting additional packets. The driver will exit
                                the Dhcp4Selecting state and enter the Dhcp4Requesting state.
  @retval EFI_NOT_READY         Only used in the Dhcp4Selecting state. The EFI DHCPv4 Protocol
                                driver will continue to wait for more packets until the retry
                                timeout expires.
  @retval EFI_ABORTED           Tells the EFI DHCPv4 Protocol driver to abort the current process and
                                return to the Dhcp4Init or Dhcp4InitReboot state.

  Initializes, changes, or resets the operational settings for the EFI DHCPv4 Protocol driver.

  The Configure() function is used to initialize, change, or reset the operational
  settings of the EFI DHCPv4 Protocol driver for the communication device on which
  the EFI DHCPv4 Service Binding Protocol is installed. This function can be
  successfully called only if both of the following are true:

    Dhcp4InitReboot, or Dhcp4Bound states.

    Protocol driver.
  When this driver is in the Dhcp4Stopped state, it can transfer into one of the
  following two possible initial states:
  * Dhcp4Init
  * Dhcp4InitReboot.
  The driver can transfer into these states by calling Configure() with a non-NULL

  supplied client network address in the ClientAddress parameter and DHCP options
  in the OptionList parameter as described in RFC 2131.

  state into the Dhcp4Renewing state (or Dhcp4Rebinding when RebindingRequest is
  TRUE). When a response is received, the state is returned to Dhcp4Bound.
  If no response is received before the try count is exceeded (the RequestTryCount
  field that is specified in EFI_DHCP4_CONFIG_DATA) but before the lease time that
  was issued by the previous server expires, the driver will return to the Dhcp4Bound
  state, and the previous configuration is restored. The outgoing and incoming packets

                          the Dhcp4Rebinding state. Otherwise, it sends a unicast
                          request packet and enters the Dhcp4Renewing state.

                          completes or some error occurs.
