  ISA HC Protocol as defined in the PI 1.2.1 specification.

  This protocol provides registration for ISA devices on a positive- or
  subtractive-decode ISA bus. It allows devices to be registered and also
  handles opening and closing the apertures which are positively-decoded.

/**
  Open I/O aperture.

  This function opens an I/O aperture in a ISA Host Controller for the I/O addresses
  specified by IoAddress to IoAddress + IoLength - 1. It may be possible that a
  single hardware aperture may be used for more than one device. This function
  tracks the number of times that each aperture is referenced, and does not close
  the hardware aperture (via CloseIoAperture()) until there are no more references to it.

  @param This             A pointer to this instance of the EFI_ISA_HC_PROTOCOL.
  @param IoAddress        An unsigned integer that specifies the first byte of the
                          I/O space required.
  @param IoLength         An unsigned integer that specifies the number of bytes
                          of the I/O space required.
  @param IoApertureHandle A pointer to the returned I/O aperture handle. This
                          value can be used on subsequent calls to CloseIoAperture().

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS          The I/O aperture was opened successfully.
  @retval EFI_UNSUPPORTED      The ISA Host Controller is a subtractive-decode controller.
  @retval EFI_OUT_OF_RESOURCES There is no available I/O aperture.

  Close I/O aperture.

  hardware aperture may be used for more than one device. This function tracks
