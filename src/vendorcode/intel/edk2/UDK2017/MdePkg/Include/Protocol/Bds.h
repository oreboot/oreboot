  This function uses policy data from the platform to determine what operating
  system or system utility should be loaded and invoked.  This function call
  also optionally make the use of user input to determine the operating system
  or system utility to be loaded and invoked.  When the DXE Core has dispatched
  all the drivers on the dispatch queue, this function is called.  This
  function will attempt to connect the boot devices required to load and invoke
  the selected operating system or system utility.  During this process,
  additional firmware volumes may be discovered that may contain addition DXE
  drivers that can be dispatched by the DXE Core.   If a boot device cannot be
  fully connected, this function calls the DXE Service Dispatch() to allow the
  DXE drivers from any newly discovered firmware volumes to be dispatched.
  Then the boot device connection can be attempted again.  If the same boot
  device connection operation fails twice in a row, then that boot device has
  failed, and should be skipped.  This function should never return.

  @param  This             The EFI_BDS_ARCH_PROTOCOL instance.
