/**
  Initiate a SPI transaction between the host and a SPI peripheral.

  This routine must be called at or below TPL_NOTIFY.
  This routine works with the SPI bus layer to pass the SPI transaction to the
  SPI controller for execution on the SPI bus. There are four types of
  supported transactions supported by this routine:
  * Full Duplex: WriteBuffer and ReadBuffer are the same size.
  * Write Only: WriteBuffer contains data for SPI peripheral, ReadBytes = 0
  * Read Only: ReadBuffer to receive data from SPI peripheral, WriteBytes = 0
  * Write Then Read: WriteBuffer contains control data to write to SPI
                     peripheral before data is placed into the ReadBuffer.
                     Both WriteBytes and ReadBytes must be non-zero.

  @param[in]  This              Pointer to an EFI_SPI_IO_PROTOCOL structure.
  @param[in]  TransactionType   Type of SPI transaction.
  @param[in]  DebugTransaction  Set TRUE only when debugging is desired.
                                Debugging may be turned on for a single SPI
                                transaction. Only this transaction will display
                                debugging messages. All other transactions with
                                this value set to FALSE will not display any
                                debugging messages.
  @param[in]  ClockHz           Specify the ClockHz value as zero (0) to use
                                the maximum clock frequency supported by the
                                SPI controller and part. Specify a non-zero
                                value only when a specific SPI transaction
                                requires a reduced clock rate.
  @param[in]  BusWidth          Width of the SPI bus in bits: 1, 2, 4
  @param[in]  FrameSize         Frame size in bits, range: 1 - 32
  @param[in]  WriteBytes        The length of the WriteBuffer in bytes.
                                Specify zero for read-only operations.
  @param[in]  WriteBuffer       The buffer containing data to be sent from the
                                host to the SPI chip. Specify NULL for read
                                only operations.
                                * Frame sizes 1-8 bits: UINT8 (one byte) per
                                  frame
                                * Frame sizes 7-16 bits: UINT16 (two bytes) per
                                  frame
                                * Frame sizes 17-32 bits: UINT32 (four bytes)
                                  per frame The transmit frame is in the least
                                  significant N bits.
  @param[in]  ReadBytes         The length of the ReadBuffer in bytes.
                                Specify zero for write-only operations.
  @param[out] ReadBuffer        The buffer to receeive data from the SPI chip
                                during the transaction. Specify NULL for write
                                only operations.
                                * Frame sizes 1-8 bits: UINT8 (one byte) per
                                  frame
                                * Frame sizes 7-16 bits: UINT16 (two bytes) per
                                  frame
                                * Frame sizes 17-32 bits: UINT32 (four bytes)
                                  per frame The received frame is in the least
                                  significant N bits.
