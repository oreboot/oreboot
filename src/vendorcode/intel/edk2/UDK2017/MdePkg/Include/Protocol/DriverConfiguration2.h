/**
  Allows the user to set controller specific options for a controller that a
  driver is currently managing.

  @param  This             A pointer to the EFI_DRIVER_CONFIGURATION2_PROTOCOL instance.
  @param  ControllerHandle The handle of the controller to set options on.
  @param  ChildHandle      The handle of the child controller to set options on.  This
                           is an optional parameter that may be NULL.  It will be NULL
                           for device drivers, and for bus drivers that wish to set
                           options for the bus controller.  It will not be NULL for a
                           bus driver that wishes to set options for one of its child
                           controllers.
  @param  Language         A Null-terminated ASCII string that contains one or more RFC 4646
                           language codes. This is the list of language codes that this
                           protocol supports. The number of languages
                           supported by a driver is up to the driver writer.
  @param  ActionRequired   A pointer to the action that the calling agent is required
                           to perform when this function returns.  See "Related
                           Definitions" for a list of the actions that the calling
                           agent is required to perform prior to accessing
                           ControllerHandle again.

  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER ControllerHandle is not a valid EFI_HANDLE.
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER ChildHandle is not NULL and it is not a valid EFI_HANDLE.

                                language specified by Language.

                                configuration options for the controller specified
                                by ControllerHandle and ChildHandle.
  @retval EFI_OUT_RESOURCES     There are not enough resources available to set the
                                configuration options for the controller specified
                                by ControllerHandle and ChildHandle.
