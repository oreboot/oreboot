  EFI ARP Protocol Definition

  The EFI ARP Service Binding Protocol is used to locate EFI
  ARP Protocol drivers to create and destroy child of the
  driver to communicate with other host using ARP protocol.
  The EFI ARP Protocol provides services to map IP network
  address to hardware address used by a data link protocol.

  This function is used to assign a station address to the ARP cache for this instance

  Each ARP instance has one station address. The EFI_ARP_PROTOCOL driver will
  respond to ARP requests that match this registered station address. A call to
  this function with the ConfigData field set to NULL will reset this ARP instance.

  Once a protocol type and station address have been assigned to this ARP instance,
  all the following ARP functions will use this information. Attempting to change
  the protocol type or station address to a configured ARP instance will result in errors.

  @param  ConfigData             The pointer to the EFI_ARP_CONFIG_DATA structure.

                                 registered.

/**
  This function is used to insert entries into the ARP cache.

  ARP cache entries are typically inserted and updated by network protocol drivers
  as network traffic is processed. Most ARP cache entries will time out and be
  deleted if the network traffic stops. ARP cache entries that were inserted
  by the Add() function may be static (will not time out) or dynamic (will time out).
  Default ARP cache timeout values are not covered in most network protocol
  specifications (although RFC 1122 comes pretty close) and will only be
  discussed in general terms in this specification. The timeout values that are
  used in the EFI Sample Implementation should be used only as a guideline.
  Final product implementations of the EFI network stack should be tuned for
  their expected network environments.

  @param  This                   Pointer to the EFI_ARP_PROTOCOL instance.
  @param  DenyFlag               Set to TRUE if this entry is a deny entry. Set to
                                 FALSE if this  entry is a normal entry.
  @param  TargetSwAddress        Pointer to a protocol address to add (or deny).
                                 May be set to NULL if DenyFlag is TRUE.
  @param  TargetHwAddress        Pointer to a hardware address to add (or deny).
                                 May be set to NULL if DenyFlag is TRUE.
  @param  TimeoutValue           Time in 100-ns units that this entry will remain
                                 in the ARP cache. A value of zero means that the
                                 entry is permanent. A nonzero value will override
                                 the one given by Configure() if the entry to be
                                 added is a dynamic entry.
  @param  Overwrite              If TRUE, the matching cache entry will be
                                 overwritten with the supplied parameters. If

                                 corresponding cache entry already exists.
