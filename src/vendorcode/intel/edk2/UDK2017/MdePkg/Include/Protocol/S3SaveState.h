/**
  Record operations that need to be replayed during an S3 resume.

  This function is used to store an OpCode to be replayed as part of the S3 resume boot path. It is
  assumed this protocol has platform specific mechanism to store the OpCode set and replay them
  during the S3 resume.
  The opcode is inserted before or after the specified position in the boot script table. If Position is
  NULL then that position is after the last opcode in the table (BeforeOrAfter is TRUE) or before
  the first opcode in the table (BeforeOrAfter is FALSE). The position which is pointed to by
  Position upon return can be used for subsequent insertions.

  This function has a variable parameter list. The exact parameter list depends on the OpCode that is
  passed into the function. If an unsupported OpCode or illegal parameter list is passed in, this
  function returns EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER.
  If there are not enough resources available for storing more scripts, this function returns
  EFI_OUT_OF_RESOURCES.
  OpCode values of 0x80 - 0xFE are reserved for implementation specific functions.

                                    in the boot script table specified by Position. If Position is NULL or points to
                                    NULL then the new opcode is inserted at the beginning of the table (if TRUE) or end
                                    of the table (if FALSE).
  @param[in, out]   Position        On entry, specifies the position in the boot script table where the opcode will be
                                    inserted, either before or after, depending on BeforeOrAfter. On exit, specifies
                                    the position of the inserted opcode in the boot script table.
  @param[in]        OpCode          The operation code (opcode) number. See "Related Definitions" in Write() for the
                                    defined opcode types.
