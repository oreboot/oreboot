/**

  This function allows the caller to request the current
  configuration for one or more named elements from one or more
  drivers. The resulting string is in the standard HII
  configuration string format. If Successful, Results contains an
  equivalent string with "=" and the values associated with all
  names added in. The expected implementation is for each
  <ConfigRequest> substring in the Request to call the HII
  Configuration Routing Protocol ExtractProtocol function for the
  driver corresponding to the <ConfigHdr> at the start of the
  <ConfigRequest> substring. The request fails if no driver
  matches the <ConfigRequest> substring. Note: Alternative
  configuration strings may also be appended to the end of the
  current configuration string. If they are, they must appear
  after the current configuration. They must contain the same
  routing (GUID, NAME, PATH) as the current configuration string.
  They must have an additional description indicating the type of
  alternative configuration the string represents,
  "ALTCFG=<StringToken>". That <StringToken> (when converted from
  hexadecimal (encoded as text) to binary) is a reference to a string in the
  associated string pack. As an example, assume that the Request
  string is:
  GUID=...&NAME=00480050&PATH=...&Fred&George&Ron&Neville A result
  might be:
  GUID=...&NAME=00480050&PATH=...&Fred=16&George=16&Ron=12&Neville=11&
  GUID=...&NAME=00480050&PATH=...&ALTCFG=0037&Fred=12&Neville=7

  @param This       Points to the EFI_HII_CONFIG_ROUTING_PROTOCOL
                    instance.

  @param Request    A null-terminated string in <MultiConfigRequest> format.

  @param Progress   On return, points to a character in the
                    Request string. Points to the string's null
                    terminator if the request was successful. Points
                    to the most recent '&' before the first
                    failing name / value pair (or the beginning
                    of the string if the failure is in the first
                    name / value pair) if the request was not
                    successful

  @param Results    A null-terminated string in <MultiConfigAltResp> format
                    which has all values filled in for the names in the
                    Request string.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS             The Results string is filled with the
                                  values corresponding to all requested

                                  would result in this type of
                                  error. The Progress parameter
                                  is set to NULL.

  @retval EFI_NOT_FOUND           Routing data doesn't match any
                                  known driver. Progress set to

                                  requirement that all routing
                                  data be validated before any
                                  configuration extraction.
