  EFI SMM Configuration Protocol as defined in the PI 1.2 specification.

  This protocol is used to:
  1) report the portions of SMRAM regions which cannot be used for the SMRAM heap.
  2) register the SMM Foundation entry point with the processor code. The entry
     point will be invoked by the SMM processor entry code.
