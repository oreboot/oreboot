  EFI TCPv6(Transmission Control Protocol version 6) Protocol Definition
  The EFI TCPv6 Service Binding Protocol is used to locate EFI TCPv6 Protocol drivers to create
  and destroy child of the driver to communicate with other host using TCP protocol.
  The EFI TCPv6 Protocol provides services to send and receive data stream.
