  This file declares EFI IDE Controller Init Protocol

  The EFI_IDE_CONTROLLER_INIT_PROTOCOL provides the chipset-specific information
  to the driver entity. This protocol is mandatory for IDE controllers if the
  IDE devices behind the controller are to be enumerated by a driver entity.

  There can only be one instance of EFI_IDE_CONTROLLER_INIT_PROTOCOL for each IDE
  controller in a system. It is installed on the handle that corresponds to the
  IDE controller. A driver entity that wishes to manage an IDE bus and possibly
  IDE devices in a system will have to retrieve the EFI_IDE_CONTROLLER_INIT_PROTOCOL
  instance that is associated with the controller to be managed.

  A device handle for an IDE controller must contain an EFI_DEVICE_PATH_PROTOCOL.

/**
  Returns the information about the specified IDE channel.

  This function can be used to obtain information about a particular IDE channel.
  The driver entity uses this information during the enumeration process.

  If Enabled is set to FALSE, the driver entity will not scan the channel. Note
  that it will not prevent an operating system driver from scanning the channel.

  For most of today's controllers, MaxDevices will either be 1 or 2. For SATA
  controllers, this value will always be 1. SATA configurations can contain SATA
  port multipliers. SATA port multipliers behave like SATA bridges and can support
  up to 16 devices on the other side. If a SATA port out of the IDE controller
  is connected to a port multiplier, MaxDevices will be set to the number of SATA
  devices that the port multiplier supports. Because today's port multipliers
  support up to fifteen SATA devices, this number can be as large as fifteen. The IDE
  bus driver is required to scan for the presence of port multipliers behind an SATA
  controller and enumerate up to MaxDevices number of devices behind the port
  multiplier.

  In this context, the devices behind a port multiplier constitute a channel.

  @param[in]  This         The pointer to the EFI_IDE_CONTROLLER_INIT_PROTOCOL instance.
  @param[in]  Channel      Zero-based channel number.
  @param[out] Enabled      TRUE if this channel is enabled.  Disabled channels
                           are not scanned to see if any devices are present.
  @param[out] MaxDevices   The maximum number of IDE devices that the bus driver
                           can expect on this channel.  For the ATA/ATAPI
                           specification, version 6, this number will either be
                           one or two. For Serial ATA (SATA) configurations with a
                           port multiplier, this number can be as large as fifteen.

  Submits the device information to the IDE controller driver.

  This function is used by the driver entity to pass detailed information about
  a particular device to the IDE controller driver. The driver entity obtains
  this information by issuing an ATA or ATAPI IDENTIFY_DEVICE command. IdentifyData
  is the pointer to the response data buffer. The IdentifyData buffer is owned
  by the driver entity, and the IDE controller driver must make a local copy
  of the entire buffer or parts of the buffer as needed. The original IdentifyData
  buffer pointer may not be valid when

    - EFI_IDE_CONTROLLER_INIT_PROTOCOL.CalculateMode() or
    - EFI_IDE_CONTROLLER_INIT_PROTOCOL.DisqualifyMode() is called at a later point.

  The IDE controller driver may consult various fields of EFI_IDENTIFY_DATA to
  compute the optimum mode for the device. These fields are not limited to the
  timing information. For example, an implementation of the IDE controller driver
  may examine the vendor and type/mode field to match known bad drives.

  The driver entity may submit drive information in any order, as long as it
  submits information for all the devices belonging to the enumeration group
  before EFI_IDE_CONTROLLER_INIT_PROTOCOL.CalculateMode() is called for any device
  in that enumeration group. If a device is absent, EFI_IDE_CONTROLLER_INIT_PROTOCOL.SubmitData()
  should be called with IdentifyData set to NULL.  The IDE controller driver may
  not have any other mechanism to know whether a device is present or not. Therefore,
  setting IdentifyData to NULL does not constitute an error condition.
  EFI_IDE_CONTROLLER_INIT_PROTOCOL.SubmitData() can be called only once for a

/**
  Disqualifies specific modes for an IDE device.

  This function allows the driver entity or other drivers (such as platform
  drivers) to reject certain timing modes and request the IDE controller driver
  to recalculate modes. This function allows the driver entity and the IDE
  controller driver to negotiate the timings on a per-device basis. This function
  is useful in the case of drives that lie about their capabilities. An example
  is when the IDE device fails to accept the timing modes that are calculated
  by the IDE controller driver based on the response to the Identify Drive command.

  If the driver entity does not want to limit the ATA timing modes and leave that
  decision to the IDE controller driver, it can either not call this function for
  the given device or call this function and set the Valid flag to FALSE for all
  modes that are listed in EFI_ATA_COLLECTIVE_MODE.

  The driver entity may disqualify modes for a device in any order and any number
  of times.

  This function can be called multiple times to invalidate multiple modes of the
  same type (e.g., Programmed Input/Output [PIO] modes 3 and 4). See the ATA/ATAPI
  specification for more information on PIO modes.

  For Serial ATA (SATA) controllers, this member function can be used to disqualify
  a higher transfer rate mode on a given channel. For example, a platform driver
  may inform the IDE controller driver to not use second-generation (Gen2) speeds
  for a certain SATA drive.

/**
  Returns the information about the optimum modes for the specified IDE device.

  This function is used by the driver entity to obtain the optimum ATA modes for
  a specific device.  The IDE controller driver takes into account the following
  while calculating the mode:
    - The IdentifyData inputs to EFI_IDE_CONTROLLER_INIT_PROTOCOL.SubmitData()
    - The BadModes inputs to EFI_IDE_CONTROLLER_INIT_PROTOCOL.DisqualifyMode()

  The driver entity is required to call EFI_IDE_CONTROLLER_INIT_PROTOCOL.SubmitData()
  for all the devices that belong to an enumeration group before calling
  EFI_IDE_CONTROLLER_INIT_PROTOCOL.CalculateMode() for any device in the same group.

  The IDE controller driver will use controller- and possibly platform-specific
  algorithms to arrive at SupportedModes.  The IDE controller may base its
  decision on user preferences and other considerations as well. This function
  may be called multiple times because the driver entity may renegotiate the mode
  with the IDE controller driver using EFI_IDE_CONTROLLER_INIT_PROTOCOL.DisqualifyMode().

  The driver entity may collect timing information for various devices in any
  order. The driver entity is responsible for making sure that all the dependencies
  are satisfied. For example, the SupportedModes information for device A that
  was previously returned may become stale after a call to
  EFI_IDE_CONTROLLER_INIT_PROTOCOL.DisqualifyMode() for device B.

  The buffer SupportedModes is allocated by the callee because the caller does
  not necessarily know the size of the buffer. The type EFI_ATA_COLLECTIVE_MODE
  is defined in a way that allows for future extensibility and can be of variable
  length. This memory pool should be deallocated by the caller when it is no
  longer necessary.

  The IDE controller driver for a Serial ATA (SATA) controller can use this
  member function to force a lower speed (first-generation [Gen1] speeds on a
  second-generation [Gen2]-capable hardware).  The IDE controller driver can
  also allow the driver entity to stay with the speed that has been negotiated
  by the physical layer.
