  EFI Driver Health Protocol definitions.

  When installed, the Driver Health Protocol produces a collection of services that allow
  the health status for a controller to be retrieved. If a controller is not in a usable
  state, status messages may be reported to the user, repair operations can be invoked,
  and the user may be asked to make software and/or hardware configuration changes.

  The Driver Health Protocol is optionally produced by a driver that follows the
  EFI Driver Model.  If an EFI Driver needs to report health status to the platform,
  provide warning or error messages to the user, perform length repair operations,
  or request the user to make hardware or software configuration changes, then the
  Driver Health Protocol must be produced.

  A controller that is managed by driver that follows the EFI Driver Model and
  produces the Driver Health Protocol must report the current health of the
  controllers that the driver is currently managing.  The controller can initially
  be healthy, failed, require repair, or require configuration.  If a controller
  requires configuration, and the user make configuration changes, the controller
  may then need to be reconnected or the system may need to be rebooted for the
  configuration changes to take affect.

/**
  Retrieves the health status of a controller in the platform.  This function can also
  optionally return warning messages, error messages, and a set of HII Forms that may
  be repair a controller that is not proper configured.

  @param[in] This             A pointer to the EFI_DRIVER_HEALTH_PROTOCOL instance.

  @param[in] ControllerHandle The handle of the controller to retrieve the health status
                              on.  This is an optional parameter that may be NULL.  If
                              this parameter is NULL, then the value of ChildHandle is
                              ignored, and the combined health status of all the devices
                              that the driver is managing is returned.

  @param[in] ChildHandle      The handle of the child controller to retrieve the health
                              status on.  This is an optional parameter that may be NULL.
                              This parameter is ignored of ControllerHandle is NULL.  It
                              will be NULL for device drivers.  It will also be NULL for
                              bus drivers when an attempt is made to collect the health
                              status of the bus controller.  If will not be NULL when an
                              attempt is made to collect the health status for a child
                              controller produced by the driver.

  @param[out] HealthStatus    A pointer to the health status that is returned by this
                              function.  This is an optional parameter that may be NULL.
                              This parameter is ignored of ControllerHandle is NULL.
                              The health status for the controller specified by
                              ControllerHandle and ChildHandle is returned.

  @param[out] MessageList     A pointer to an array of warning or error messages associated
                              with the controller specified by ControllerHandle and
                              ChildHandle.  This is an optional parameter that may be NULL.
                              MessageList is allocated by this function with the EFI Boot
                              Service AllocatePool(), and it is the caller's responsibility
                              to free MessageList with the EFI Boot Service FreePool().
                              Each message is specified by tuple of an EFI_HII_HANDLE and
                              an EFI_STRING_ID.  The array of messages is terminated by tuple
                              containing a EFI_HII_HANDLE with a value of NULL.  The
                              EFI_HII_STRING_PROTOCOL.GetString() function can be used to
                              retrieve the warning or error message as a Null-terminated
                              string in a specific language.  Messages may be
                              returned for any of the HealthStatus values except

                              configuration is required. The HII handle is associated with
                              the controller specified by ControllerHandle and ChildHandle.
                              If this is NULL, then no HII form is available. An HII handle
                              will only be returned with a HealthStatus value of
                              EfiDriverHealthStatusConfigurationRequired.

                                MessageList, and FormList parameters are ignored.

                                returned in MessageList, and a list of HII Forms
                                may be optionally returned in FormList.

  @retval EFI_UNSUPPORTED       ControllerHandle is not NULL, and the controller
                                specified by ControllerHandle and ChildHandle is not
                                currently being managed by the driver specified by This.
