  EFI_USB_HC_PROTOCOL as defined in EFI 1.10.

  The USB Host Controller Protocol is used by code, typically USB bus drivers,
  running in the EFI boot services environment, to perform data transactions
  over a USB bus. In addition, it provides an abstraction for the root hub of the USB bus.

/**
  Submits nonblocking isochronous transfer to an isochronous endpoint of a USB device.

  @param  This                  A pointer to the EFI_USB_HC_PROTOCOL instance.
  @param  DeviceAddress         Represents the address of the target device on the USB, which is
                                assigned during USB enumeration.
  @param  EndPointAddress       The combination of an endpoint number and an endpoint
                                direction of the target USB device. Each endpoint address
                                supports data transfer in one direction except the control
                                endpoint (whose default endpoint address is zero). It is the
                                caller's responsibility to make sure that the
                                EndPointAddress represents an isochronous endpoint.
  @param  MaximumPacketLength   Indicates the maximum packet size that the default control
                                transfer endpoint is capable of sending or receiving. For isochronous
                                endpoints, this value is used to reserve the bus time in the schedule,
                                required for the perframe data payloads. The pipe may, on an ongoing basis,
                                actually use less bandwidth than that reserved.
  @param  Data                  A pointer to the buffer of data that will be transmitted to USB
                                device or received from USB device.                                                                                            asynchronous interrupt pipe is canceled.
  @param  DataLength            Specifies the length, in bytes, of the data to be sent to or received
                                from the USB device.
  @param  IsochronousCallback   The Callback function.This function is called if the requested
                                isochronous transfer is completed.
  @param  Context               Data passed to the IsochronousCallback function. This is
                                an optional parameter and may be NULL.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS           The asynchronous isochronous transfer was completed successfully.
  @retval EFI_OUT_OF_RESOURCES  The asynchronous isochronous could not be completed due to a lack of resources.
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER Some parameters are invalid.
