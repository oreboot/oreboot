/** @file
  This file defines the EFI IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4)
  Protocol interface. It is split into the following three main
  sections:
  - EFI IPv4 Service Binding Protocol
  - EFI IPv4 Variable (deprecated in UEFI 2.4B)
  - EFI IPv4 Protocol.
  The EFI IPv4 Protocol provides basic network IPv4 packet I/O services,
  which includes support foR a subset of the Internet Control Message
  Protocol (ICMP) and may include support for the Internet Group Management
  Protocol (IGMP).

  Adds and deletes routing table entries.

  The Routes() function adds a route to or deletes a route from the routing table.

  Routes are determined by comparing the SubnetAddress with the destination IPv4
  address arithmetically AND-ed with the SubnetMask. The gateway address must be
  on the same subnet as the configured station address.

  The default route is added with SubnetAddress and SubnetMask both set to 0.0.0.0.
  The default route matches all destination IPv4 addresses that do not match any
  other routes.

  A GatewayAddress that is zero is a nonroute. Packets are sent to the destination
  IP address if it can be found in the ARP cache or on the local subnet. One automatic
  nonroute entry will be inserted into the routing table for outgoing packets that
  are addressed to a local subnet (gateway address of 0.0.0.0).

  Each EFI IPv4 Protocol instance has its own independent routing table. Those EFI
  IPv4 Protocol instances that use the default IPv4 address will also have copies
  of the routing table that was provided by the EFI_IP4_CONFIG_PROTOCOL, and these
  copies will be updated whenever the EIF IPv4 Protocol driver reconfigures its
  instances. As a result, client modification to the routing table will be lost.

  Abort an asynchronous transmit or receive request.

  The Cancel() function is used to abort a pending transmit or receive request.
  If the token is in the transmit or receive request queues, after calling this
  function, Token->Status will be set to EFI_ABORTED and then Token->Event will
  be signaled. If the token is not in one of the queues, which usually means the
  asynchronous operation has completed, this function will not signal the token
  and EFI_NOT_FOUND is returned.

  @param  This  The pointer to the EFI_IP4_PROTOCOL instance.
  @param  Token The pointer to a token that has been issued by
                EFI_IP4_PROTOCOL.Transmit() or
                EFI_IP4_PROTOCOL.Receive(). If NULL, all pending
                tokens are aborted. Type EFI_IP4_COMPLETION_TOKEN is

                                pending requests were aborted and their events were signaled.
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER This is NULL.

  @retval EFI_NOT_FOUND         When Token is not NULL, the asynchronous I/O request was
                                not found in the transmit or receive queue. It has either completed
                                or was not issued by Transmit() and Receive().

/**
  Polls for incoming data packets and processes outgoing data packets.

  The Poll() function polls for incoming data packets and processes outgoing data
  packets. Network drivers and applications can call the EFI_IP4_PROTOCOL.Poll()
  function to increase the rate that data packets are moved between the communications
  device and the transmit and receive queues.

  In some systems the periodic timer event may not poll the underlying communications
  device fast enough to transmit and/or receive all data packets without missing
  incoming packets or dropping outgoing packets. Drivers and applications that are
  experiencing packet loss should try calling the EFI_IP4_PROTOCOL.Poll() function
  more often.

  @param  This The pointer to the EFI_IP4_PROTOCOL instance.

  @retval  EFI_SUCCESS           Incoming or outgoing data was processed.
  @retval  EFI_NOT_STARTED       This EFI IPv4 Protocol instance has not been started.

  @retval  EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER This is NULL.
  @retval  EFI_DEVICE_ERROR      An unexpected system or network error occurred.
  @retval  EFI_NOT_READY         No incoming or outgoing data is processed.
  @retval  EFI_TIMEOUT           Data was dropped out of the transmit and/or receive queue.
