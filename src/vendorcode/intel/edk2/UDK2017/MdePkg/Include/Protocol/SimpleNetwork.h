  @param  Buffer     A pointer to the packet (media header followed by data) to be
                     transmitted. This parameter cannot be NULL. If HeaderSize is zero,
                     then the media header in Buffer must already be filled in by the
                     caller. If HeaderSize is non-zero, then the media header will be
                     filled in by the Transmit() function.
  @param  SrcAddr    The source HW MAC address. If HeaderSize is zero, then this parameter
                     is ignored. If HeaderSize is non-zero and SrcAddr is NULL, then
                     This->Mode->CurrentAddress is used for the source HW MAC address.
  @param  DestAddr   The destination HW MAC address. If HeaderSize is zero, then this
                     parameter is ignored.
  @param  Protocol   The type of header to build. If HeaderSize is zero, then this
                     parameter is ignored. See RFC 1700, section "Ether Types", for
                     examples.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS           The packet was placed on the transmit queue.
  @retval EFI_NOT_STARTED       The network interface has not been started.
  @retval EFI_NOT_READY         The network interface is too busy to accept this transmit request.
  @retval EFI_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL  The BufferSize parameter is too small.
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER One or more of the parameters has an unsupported value.
  @retval EFI_DEVICE_ERROR      The command could not be sent to the network interface.
  @retval EFI_UNSUPPORTED       This function is not supported by the network interface.

/**
  Receives a packet from a network interface.

  @param  This       The protocol instance pointer.
  @param  HeaderSize The size, in bytes, of the media header received on the network
                     interface. If this parameter is NULL, then the media header size
                     will not be returned.
  @param  BufferSize On entry, the size, in bytes, of Buffer. On exit, the size, in
                     bytes, of the packet that was received on the network interface.
  @param  Buffer     A pointer to the data buffer to receive both the media header and
                     the data.
  @param  SrcAddr    The source HW MAC address. If this parameter is NULL, the
                     HW MAC source address will not be extracted from the media
                     header.
  @param  DestAddr   The destination HW MAC address. If this parameter is NULL,
                     the HW MAC destination address will not be extracted from the
                     media header.
  @param  Protocol   The media header type. If this parameter is NULL, then the
                     protocol will not be extracted from the media header. See
                     RFC 1700 section "Ether Types" for examples.

  @retval  EFI_SUCCESS           The received data was stored in Buffer, and BufferSize has
                                 been updated to the number of bytes received.
  @retval  EFI_NOT_STARTED       The network interface has not been started.
  @retval  EFI_NOT_READY         The network interface is too busy to accept this transmit
                                 request.
  @retval  EFI_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL  The BufferSize parameter is too small.
  @retval  EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER One or more of the parameters has an unsupported value.
  @retval  EFI_DEVICE_ERROR      The command could not be sent to the network interface.
