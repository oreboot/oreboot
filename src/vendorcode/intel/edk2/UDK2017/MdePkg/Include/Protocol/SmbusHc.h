  The Execute() function provides a standard way to execute an
  operation as defined in the System Management Bus (SMBus)
  Specification. The resulting transaction will be either that
  the SMBus slave devices accept this transaction or that this
  function returns with error.

  @param This     A pointer to the EFI_SMBUS_HC_PROTOCOL instance.
                  SlaveAddress The SMBus slave address of the device
                  with which to communicate. Type
                  EFI_SMBUS_DEVICE_ADDRESS is defined in
                  EFI_PEI_SMBUS_PPI.Execute() in the Platform
                  Initialization SMBus PPI Specification.

  @param Command  This command is transmitted by the SMBus host
                  controller to the SMBus slave device and the
                  interpretation is SMBus slave device specific.
                  It can mean the offset to a list of functions
                  inside an SMBus slave device. Not all
                  operations or slave devices support this
                  command's registers. Type
                  EFI_SMBUS_DEVICE_COMMAND is defined in
                  EFI_PEI_SMBUS_PPI.Execute() in the Platform
                  Initialization SMBus PPI Specification.

 @param Operation Signifies the particular SMBus
                  hardware protocol instance it will use to
                  execute the SMBus transactions. This SMBus
                  hardware protocol is defined by the SMBus
                  Specification and is not related to PI
                  Architecture. Type EFI_SMBUS_OPERATION is
                  defined in EFI_PEI_SMBUS_PPI.Execute() in the
                  Platform Initialization SMBus PPI
                  Specification.

  @param PecCheck Defines if Packet Error Code (PEC) checking
                  is required for this operation. SMBus Host
                  Controller Code Definitions Version 1.0
                  August 21, 2006 13

 @param Length    Signifies the number of bytes that this operation will do.
                  The maximum number of bytes can be revision
                  specific and operation specific. This field
                  will contain the actual number of bytes that
                  are executed for this operation. Not all
                  operations require this argument.

  @param Buffer   Contains the value of data to execute to the
                  SMBus slave device. Not all operations require
                  this argument. The length of this buffer is
                  identified by Length.


  @retval EFI_SUCCESS           The last data that was returned from the
                                access matched the poll exit criteria.

  @retval EFI_CRC_ERROR         Checksum is not correct (PEC is incorrect).

  @retval EFI_TIMEOUT           Timeout expired before the operation was
                                completed. Timeout is determined by the
                                SMBus host controller device.

  @retval EFI_OUT_OF_RESOURCES  The request could not be
                                completed due to a lack of
                                resources.

  @retval EFI_DEVICE_ERROR      The request was not completed
                                because a failure that was reflected
                                in the Host Status Register bit.
                                Device errors are a result of a
                                transaction collision, illegal
                                command field, unclaimed cycle (host
                                initiated), or bus errors
                                (collisions).

  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER Operation is not defined in
                                EFI_SMBUS_OPERATION.

  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER Length/Buffer is NULL for
                                operations except for
                                EfiSmbusQuickRead and
                                EfiSmbusQuickWrite. Length is
                                outside the range of valid
                                values.

  @retval EFI_UNSUPPORTED       The SMBus operation or PEC is not
                                supported.

  @retval EFI_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL  Buffer is not sufficient for
                                this operation.
