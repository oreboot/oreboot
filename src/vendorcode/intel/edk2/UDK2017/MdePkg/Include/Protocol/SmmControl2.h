/** @file
  EFI SMM Control2 Protocol as defined in the PI 1.2 specification.

  This protocol is used initiate synchronous SMI activations. This protocol could be published by a
  processor driver to abstract the SMI IPI or a driver which abstracts the ASIC that is supporting the
  APM port. Because of the possibility of performing SMI IPI transactions, the ability to generate this
  event from a platform chipset agent is an optional capability for both IA-32 and x64-based systems.

  The EFI_SMM_CONTROL2_PROTOCOL is produced by a runtime driver. It provides  an
  abstraction of the platform hardware that generates an SMI.  There are often I/O ports that, when
  accessed, will generate the SMI.  Also, the hardware optionally supports the periodic generation of
  these signals.
