                                 MUST be set to 0. However, in the future,
                                 feature flags may be defined that, for example,
                                 enable hash algorithm agility.
  @param  EventLogLocation       This is a pointer to the address of the event log in memory.
  @param  EventLogLastEntry      If the Event Log contains more than one entry,
                                 this is a pointer to the address of the start of
                                 the last entry in the event log in memory.
