  This function of this type is called when a timer interrupt fires.  This

  of this type to be called for the timer interrupt, so it can know how much
  time has passed.  This information is used to signal timer based events.

  @param  Time   Time since the last timer interrupt in 100 ns units. This will
                 typically be TimerPeriod, but if a timer interrupt is missed, and the
                 EFI_TIMER_ARCH_PROTOCOL driver can detect missed interrupts, then Time
                 will contain the actual amount of time since the last interrupt.

  returned.  If the CPU does not support registering a timer interrupt handler,

  when a handler is already registered, then EFI_ALREADY_STARTED is returned.
  If an attempt is made to unregister a handler when a handler is not registered,
  then EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER is returned.  If an error occurs attempting to
  register the NotifyFunction with the timer interrupt, then EFI_DEVICE_ERROR

  This function adjusts the period of timer interrupts to the value specified
  by TimerPeriod.  If the timer period is updated, then the selected timer
  period is stored in EFI_TIMER.TimerPeriod, and EFI_SUCCESS is returned.  If
  the timer hardware is not programmable, then EFI_UNSUPPORTED is returned.
  If an error occurs while attempting to update the timer period, then the
  timer hardware will be put back in its state prior to this call, and
  EFI_DEVICE_ERROR is returned.  If TimerPeriod is 0, then the timer interrupt
  is disabled.  This is not the same as disabling the CPU's interrupts.
  Instead, it must either turn off the timer hardware, or it must adjust the
  interrupt controller so that a CPU interrupt is not generated when the timer
  interrupt fires.

  @param  This             The EFI_TIMER_ARCH_PROTOCOL instance.
  @param  TimerPeriod      The rate to program the timer interrupt in 100 nS units. If
                           the timer hardware is not programmable, then EFI_UNSUPPORTED is
                           returned. If the timer is programmable, then the timer period
                           will be rounded up to the nearest timer period that is supported
                           by the timer hardware. If TimerPeriod is set to 0, then the
                           timer interrupts will be disabled.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS           The timer period was changed.
  @retval EFI_UNSUPPORTED       The platform cannot change the period of the timer interrupt.
  @retval EFI_DEVICE_ERROR      The timer period could not be changed due to a device error.
