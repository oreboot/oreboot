  UEFI Firmware Management Protocol definition
  Firmware Management Protocol provides an abstraction for device to provide firmware
  management support. The base requirements for managing device firmware images include
  identifying firmware image revision level and programming the image into the device.

  GetImageInfo() is the only required function. GetImage(), SetImage(),
  CheckImage(), GetPackageInfo(), and SetPackageInfo() shall return
  EFI_UNSUPPORTED if not supported by the driver.

/**
  Updates the firmware image of the device.

  This function updates the hardware with the new firmware image.
  This function returns EFI_UNSUPPORTED if the firmware image is not updatable.
  If the firmware image is updatable, the function should perform the following minimal validations
  before proceeding to do the firmware image update.
  - Validate the image authentication if image has attribute
    IMAGE_ATTRIBUTE_AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED. The function returns
    EFI_SECURITY_VIOLATION if the validation fails.
  - Validate the image is a supported image for this device. The function returns EFI_ABORTED if
    the image is unsupported. The function can optionally provide more detailed information on
    why the image is not a supported image.
  - Validate the data from VendorCode if not null. Image validation must be performed before
    VendorCode data validation. VendorCode data is ignored or considered invalid if image
    validation failed. The function returns EFI_ABORTED if the data is invalid.

  VendorCode enables vendor to implement vendor-specific firmware image update policy. Null if
  the caller did not specify the policy or use the default policy. As an example, vendor can implement
  a policy to allow an option to force a firmware image update when the abort reason is due to the new
  firmware image version is older than the current firmware image version or bad image checksum.
  Sensitive operations such as those wiping the entire firmware image and render the device to be
  non-functional should be encoded in the image itself rather than passed with the VendorCode.
  AbortReason enables vendor to have the option to provide a more detailed description of the abort
  reason to the caller.

                                       The format is vendor specific and new version must have a greater value
                                       than the old version. If PackageVersion is not supported, the value is
                                       0xFFFFFFFF. A value of 0xFFFFFFFE indicates that package version
                                       comparison is to be performed using PackageVersionName. A value of
                                       0xFFFFFFFD indicates that package version update is in progress.
  @param[out] PackageVersionName       A pointer to a pointer to a null-terminated string representing
                                       the package version name. The buffer is allocated by this function with
                                       AllocatePool(), and it is the caller's responsibility to free it with a
                                       call to FreePool().
  @param[out] PackageVersionNameMaxLen The maximum length of package version name if device supports update of
                                       package version name. A value of 0 indicates the device does not support
                                       update of package version name. Length is the number of Unicode characters,
                                       including the terminating null character.
  @param[out] AttributesSupported      Package attributes that are supported by this device. See 'Package Attribute
                                       Definitions' for possible returned values of this parameter. A value of 1
                                       indicates the attribute is supported and the current setting value is
                                       indicated in AttributesSetting. A value of 0 indicates the attribute is not
                                       supported and the current setting value in AttributesSetting is meaningless.
  @param[out] AttributesSetting        Package attributes. See 'Package Attribute Definitions' for possible returned
                                       values of this parameter

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS                  The package information was successfully returned.
  @retval EFI_UNSUPPORTED              The operation is not supported.

  Updates information about the firmware package.

  This function updates package information.
  This function returns EFI_UNSUPPORTED if the package information is not updatable.
  VendorCode enables vendor to implement vendor-specific package information update policy.
  Null if the caller did not specify this policy or use the default policy.

  @param[in]  This               A pointer to the EFI_FIRMWARE_MANAGEMENT_PROTOCOL instance.
  @param[in]  Image              Points to the authentication image.

  @param[in]  ImageSize          Size of the authentication image in bytes.
                                 0 if authentication is not required.
  @param[in]  VendorCode         This enables vendor to implement vendor-specific firmware

                                 Null indicates the caller did not specify this policy or use
                                 the default policy.
  @param[in]  PackageVersion     The new package version.
  @param[in]  PackageVersionName A pointer to the new null-terminated Unicode string representing
                                 the package version name.
                                 The string length is equal to or less than the value returned in

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS            The device was successfully updated with the new package
                                 information.
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER  The PackageVersionName length is longer than the value
                                 returned in PackageVersionNameMaxLen.
  @retval EFI_UNSUPPORTED        The operation is not supported.
  @retval EFI_SECURITY_VIOLATIO  The operation could not be performed due to an authentication failure.
