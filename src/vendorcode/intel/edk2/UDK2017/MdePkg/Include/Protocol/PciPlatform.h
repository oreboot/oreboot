///       resources. If a PCI device driver asks for these resources, the request

///   - EFI_RESERVE_ISA_IO_ALIAS | EFI_RESERVE_VGA_IO_ALIAS:<BR>
///       Sets aside the ISA I/O range and all the aliases during PCI
///       enumeration. VGA I/O ranges and aliases are included in ISA alias
///       ranges. In this scheme, seventy-five percent of the I/O space remains unused.
///       By using this selection, the platform indicates that it wants to support
///       PCI devices that require the following, at the cost of wasted I/O space:
///       ISA range and its aliases
///       Legacy VGA range and its aliases
///       The PCI bus driver will not allocate I/O addresses out of the ISA I/O
///       range and its aliases. The following are the ISA I/O ranges:
///         - n100..n3FF
///         - n500..n7FF
///         - n900..nBFF
///         - nD00..nFFF
///
///       In this case, the PCI bus driver will ask the PCI host bridge driver for
///       larger I/O ranges. The PCI host bridge driver is not aware of the ISA
///       aliasing policy and merely attempts to allocate the requested ranges.
///       The first device that requests the legacy VGA range will get all the
///       legacy VGA range plus its aliased addresses forwarded to it. The first
///       device that requests the legacy ISA range will get all the legacy ISA
///       range, plus its aliased addresses, forwarded to it.
///   - EFI_RESERVE_ISA_IO_NO_ALIAS | EFI_RESERVE_VGA_IO_ALIAS:<BR>
///       Sets aside the ISA I/O range (0x100 - 0x3FF) during PCI enumeration
///       and the aliases of the VGA I/O ranges. By using this selection, the
///       platform indicates that it will support VGA devices that require VGA
///       ranges, including those that require VGA aliases. The platform further
///       wants to support non-VGA devices that ask for the ISA range (0x100 -
///       3FF), but not if it also asks for the ISA aliases. The PCI bus driver will
///       not allocate I/O addresses out of the legacy ISA I/O range (0x100 -
///       0x3FF) range or the aliases of the VGA I/O range. If a PCI device
///       driver asks for the ISA I/O ranges, including aliases, the request will be
///       turned down. The first device that requests the legacy VGA range will
///       get all the legacy VGA range plus its aliased addresses forwarded to
///       it. When the legacy VGA device asks for legacy VGA ranges and its
///       aliases, all the upstream PCI-to-PCI bridges must be set up to perform
///       10-bit decode on legacy VGA ranges. To prevent two bridges from
///       positively decoding the same address, all PCI-to-PCI bridges that are
///       peers to this bridge will have to be set up to not decode ISA aliased
///       ranges. In that case, all the devices behind the peer bridges can
///       occupy only I/O addresses that are not ISA aliases. This is a limitation
///       of PCI-to-PCI bridges and is described in the white paper PCI-to-PCI
///       Bridges and Card Bus Controllers on Windows 2000, Windows XP,
///       and Windows Server 2003. The PCI enumeration process must be
///       cognizant of this restriction.
///   - EFI_RESERVE_ISA_IO_NO_ALIAS | EFI_RESERVE_VGA_IO_NO_ALIAS:<BR>
///       Sets aside the ISA I/O range (0x100 - 0x3FF) during PCI enumeration.
///       VGA I/O ranges are included in the ISA range. By using this selection,
///       the platform indicates that it wants to support PCI devices that require
///       the ISA range and legacy VGA range, but it does not want to support
///       devices that require ISA alias ranges or VGA alias ranges. The PCI
///       bus driver will not allocate I/O addresses out of the legacy ISA I/O
///       range (0x100-0x3FF). If a PCI device driver asks for the ISA I/O
///       ranges, including aliases, the request will be turned down. By using
///       this selection, the platform indicates that it will support VGA devices
///       that require VGA ranges, but it will not support VGA devices that
///       require VGA aliases. To truly support 16-bit VGA decode, all the PCIto-
///       PCI bridges that are upstream to a VGA device, as well as
///       upstream to the parent PCI root bridge, must support 16-bit VGA I/O
///       decode. See the PCI-to-PCI Bridge Architecture Specification for
///       information regarding the 16-bit VGA decode support. This
///       requirement must hold true for every VGA device in the system. If any
///       of these bridges does not support 16-bit VGA decode, it will positively
///       decode all the aliases of the VGA I/O ranges and this selection must
///       be treated like EFI_RESERVE_ISA_IO_NO_ALIAS |

  it needs to handle those errors on its own because there is no way to surface any
  errors to the caller.

  Gets the PCI device's option ROM from a platform-specific location.

  The GetPciRom() function gets the PCI device's option ROM from a platform-specific location.
  The option ROM will be loaded into memory. This member function is used to return an image
  that is packaged as a PCI 2.2 option ROM. The image may contain both legacy and EFI option
  ROMs. See the UEFI 2.0 Specification for details. This member function can be used to return
  option ROM images for embedded controllers. Option ROMs for embedded controllers are typically
  stored in platform-specific storage, and this member function can retrieve it from that storage
  and return it to the PCI bus driver. The PCI bus driver will call this member function before
  scanning the ROM that is attached to any controller, which allows a platform to specify a ROM
  image that is different from the ROM image on a PCI card.
