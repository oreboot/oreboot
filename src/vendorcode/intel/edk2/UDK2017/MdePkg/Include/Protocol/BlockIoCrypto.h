/**
  Set the configuration of the underlying inline cryptographic interface.

  The SetConfiguration() function allows the user to set the current configuration of the
  inline cryptographic interface and should be called before attempting any crypto operations.

  This configures the configuration table entries with algorithms, key sizes and keys. Each
  configured entry can later be referred to by index at the time of storage transaction.

  The configuration table index will refer to the combination ofKeyOwnerGuid, Algorithm, and
  CryptoKey.

  KeyOwnerGuid identifies the component taking ownership of the entry. It helps components to
  identify their own entries, cooperate with other owner components, and avoid conflicts. This
  Guid identifier is there to help coordination between cooperating components and not a security
  or synchronization feature. The Nil GUID can be used by a component to release use of entry
  owned. It is also used to identify potentially available entries (see GetConfiguration).

  CryptoKey specifies algorithm-specific key material to use within parameters of selected crypto
  capability.

  This function is called infrequently typically once, on device start, before IO starts. It
  can be called at later times in cases the number of keysused on the drive is higher than what
  can be configured at a time or a new key has to be added.

  Components setting or changing an entry or entries for a given index or indices must ensure
  that IO referencing affected indices is temporarily blocked (run-down) at the time of change.

  Indices parameters in each parameter table entry allow to set only a portion of the available
  table entries in the crypto module anywhere from single entry to entire table supported.

  If corresponding table entry or entries being set are already in use by another owner the call
  should be failed and none of the entries should be modified. The interface implementation must
  enforce atomicity of this operation (should either succeed fully or fail completely without
  modifying state).

  Note that components using GetConfiguration command to discover available entries should be
  prepared that by the time of calling SetConfiguration the previously available entry may have
  become occupied. Such components should be prepared to re-try the sequence of operations.

  Alternatively EFI_BLOCK_IO_CRYPTO_INDEX_ANY can be used to have the implementation discover
  and allocate available,if any, indices atomically.

  An optional ResultingTable pointer can be provided by the caller to receive the newly configured
  entries. The array provided by the caller must have at least ConfigurationCount of entries.

  returned and non-blocking I/O is being used, the Event associated with this request
  will not be signaled.

  @param[in]      This          Pointer to the EFI_BLOCK_IO_CRYPTO_PROTOCOL instance.
  @param[in, out] Token         A pointer to the token associated with the transaction.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS           The flush request was queued if Event is not NULL. All
                                outstanding data was written correctly to the device if
                                the Event is NULL.
  @retval EFI_DEVICE_ERROR      The device reported an error while attempting to write data.
  @retval EFI_WRITE_PROTECTED   The device cannot be written to.
  @retval EFI_NO_MEDIA          There is no media in the device.
  @retval EFI_MEDIA_CHANGED     The MediaId is not for the current media.
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER This is NULL.
  @retval EFI_OUT_OF_RESOURCES  The request could not be completed due to a lack of
                                resources.
