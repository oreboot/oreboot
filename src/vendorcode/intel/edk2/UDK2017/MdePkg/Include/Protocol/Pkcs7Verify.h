  EFI_PKCS7_VERIFY_PROTOCOL as defined in UEFI 2.5.
  The EFI_PKCS7_VERIFY_PROTOCOL is used to verify data signed using PKCS#7
  formatted authentication. The PKCS#7 data to be verified must be binary
  DER encoded.
  PKCS#7 is a general-purpose cryptographic standard (defined by RFC2315,
  available at http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2315).

/**
  Processes a buffer containing binary DER-encoded PKCS7 signature.
  The signed data content may be embedded within the buffer or separated. Funtion
  verifies the signature of the content is valid and signing certificate was not
  revoked and is contained within a list of trusted signers.

  @param[in]     This                 Pointer to EFI_PKCS7_VERIFY_PROTOCOL instance.
  @param[in]     SignedData           Points to buffer containing ASN.1 DER-encoded PKCS7
                                      signature.
  @param[in]     SignedDataSize       The size of SignedData buffer in bytes.
  @param[in]     InData               In case of detached signature, InData points to
                                      buffer containing the raw message data previously
                                      signed and to be verified by function. In case of

                                      NULL.
  @param[in]     InDataSize           When InData is used, the size of InData buffer in

                                      lists of X.509 certificates of approved signers.
                                      Function recognizes signer certificates of type
                                      EFI_CERT_X509_GUID. Any hash certificate in AllowedDb
                                      list is ignored by this function. Function returns
                                      success if signer of the buffer is within this list
                                      (and not within RevokedDb). This parameter is
                                      required.
  @param[in]     RevokedDb            Optional pointer to a list of pointers to
                                      EFI_SIGNATURE_LIST structures. The list is terminated

                                      revoked signers and revoked file hashes. Except as
                                      noted in description of TimeStampDb signature
                                      verification will always fail if the signer of the
                                      file or the hash of the data component of the buffer
                                      is in RevokedDb list. This list is optional and

                                      a list of X.509 certificates of trusted time stamp
                                      signers. This list is optional and caller must pass
                                      Null or pointer to NULL if not required.
  @param[out]    Content              On input, points to an optional caller-allocated
                                      buffer into which the function will copy the content
                                      portion of the file after verification succeeds.

                                      content from file is performed.
  @param[in,out] ContentSize          On input, points to the size in bytes of the optional

                                      output, if the verification succeeds, the value
                                      referenced by ContentSize will contain the actual
                                      size of the content from signed file. If ContentSize
                                      indicates the caller-allocated buffer is too small
                                      to contain content, an error is returned, and
                                      ContentSize will be updated with the required size.
                                      This parameter must be 0 if Content is Null.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS                 Content signature was verified against hash of
                                      content, the signer's certificate was not found in

                                      was found in RevokedDb.
  @retval EFI_SECURITY_VIOLATION      The SignedData buffer was correctly formatted but
                                      signer was in RevokedDb or not in AllowedDb. Also
                                      returned if matching content hash found in RevokedDb.
  @retval EFI_COMPROMISED_DATA        Calculated hash differs from signed hash.
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER       SignedData is NULL or SignedDataSize is zero.
                                      AllowedDb is NULL.
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER       Content is not NULL and ContentSize is NULL.

  @retval EFI_NOT_FOUND               Content not found because InData is NULL and no
                                      content embedded in SignedData.
  @retval EFI_UNSUPPORTED             The SignedData buffer was not correctly formatted
                                      for processing by the function.

/**
  Processes a buffer containing binary DER-encoded detached PKCS7 signature.
  The hash of the signed data content is calculated and passed by the caller. Function
  verifies the signature of the content is valid and signing certificate was not revoked
  and is contained within a list of trusted signers.

  Note: because this function uses hashes and the specification contains a variety of
        hash choices, you should be aware that the check against the RevokedDb list
        will improperly succeed if the signature is revoked using a different hash
        algorithm.  For this reason, you should either cycle through all UEFI supported
        hashes to see if one is forbidden, or rely on a single hash choice only if the
        UEFI signature authority only signs and revokes with a single hash (at time
        of writing, this hash choice is SHA256).

                                      be NULL.
  @param[in]     InHashSize           The size in bytes of InHash buffer.
