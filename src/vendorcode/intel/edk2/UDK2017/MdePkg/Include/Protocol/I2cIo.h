/**
  Queue an I2C transaction for execution on the I2C device.

  This routine must be called at or below TPL_NOTIFY.  For synchronous
  requests this routine must be called at or below TPL_CALLBACK.

  This routine queues an I2C transaction to the I2C controller for
  execution on the I2C bus.

  When Event is NULL, QueueRequest() operates synchronously and returns
  the I2C completion status as its return value.

  When Event is not NULL, QueueRequest() synchronously returns EFI_SUCCESS
  indicating that the asynchronous I2C transaction was queued.  The values
  above are returned in the buffer pointed to by I2cStatus upon the
  completion of the I2C transaction when I2cStatus is not NULL.

  The upper layer driver writer provides the following to the platform
  vendor:

  1.  Vendor specific GUID for the I2C part
  2.  Guidance on proper construction of the slave address array when the
      I2C device uses more than one slave address.  The I2C bus protocol
      uses the SlaveAddressIndex to perform relative to physical address
      translation to access the blocks of hardware within the I2C device.

  @param[in] This               Pointer to an EFI_I2C_IO_PROTOCOL structure.
  @param[in] SlaveAddressIndex  Index value into an array of slave addresses
                                for the I2C device.  The values in the array
                                are specified by the board designer, with the
                                third party I2C device driver writer providing
                                the slave address order.

                                For devices that have a single slave address,
                                this value must be zero.  If the I2C device
                                uses more than one slave address then the
                                third party (upper level) I2C driver writer
                                needs to specify the order of entries in the
                                slave address array.

                                describing the I2C transaction
  @param[out] I2cStatus         Optional buffer to receive the I2C transaction
                                completion status

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS           The asynchronous transaction was successfully
                                queued when Event is not NULL.
  @retval EFI_SUCCESS           The transaction completed successfully when
                                Event is NULL.
  @retval EFI_BAD_BUFFER_SIZE   The RequestPacket->LengthInBytes value is too
                                large.
  @retval EFI_DEVICE_ERROR      There was an I2C error (NACK) during the
                                transaction.
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER RequestPacket is NULL.
  @retval EFI_NO_MAPPING        The EFI_I2C_HOST_PROTOCOL could not set the
                                bus configuration required to access this I2C
                                device.
  @retval EFI_NO_RESPONSE       The I2C device is not responding to the slave
                                address selected by SlaveAddressIndex.
                                EFI_DEVICE_ERROR will be returned if the
                                controller cannot distinguish when the NACK
                                occurred.
  @retval EFI_OUT_OF_RESOURCES  Insufficient memory for I2C transaction
  @retval EFI_UNSUPPORTED       The controller does not support the requested
                                transaction.
