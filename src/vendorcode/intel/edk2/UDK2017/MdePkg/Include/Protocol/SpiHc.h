  Assert or deassert the SPI chip select.

  This routine is called at TPL_NOTIFY.
  Update the value of the chip select line for a SPI peripheral. The SPI bus
  layer calls this routine either in the board layer or in the SPI controller
  to manipulate the chip select pin at the start and end of a SPI transaction.

  @param[in] This           Pointer to an EFI_SPI_HC_PROTOCOL structure.
  @param[in] SpiPeripheral  The address of an EFI_SPI_PERIPHERAL data structure

                            is to be manipulated. The routine may access the
                            ChipSelectParameter field to gain sufficient
                            context to complete the operati on.
  @param[in] PinValue       The value to be applied to the chip select line of
                            the SPI peripheral.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS            The chip select was set as requested

  Set up the clock generator to produce the correct clock frequency, phase and
