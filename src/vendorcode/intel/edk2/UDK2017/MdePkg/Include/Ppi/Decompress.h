/**
  Decompress a single compression section in a firmware file.

  Decompresses the data in a compressed section and returns it
  as a series of standard PI Firmware File Sections. The
  required memory is allocated from permanent memory.

  @param This                   Points to this instance of the
                                EFI_PEI_DECOMPRESS_PEI PPI.
  @param InputSection           Points to the compressed section.
  @param OutputBuffer           Holds the returned pointer to the
                                decompressed sections.
  @param OutputSize             Holds the returned size of the decompress
                                section streams.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS           The section was decompressed
                                successfully. OutputBuffer contains the
                                resulting data and OutputSize contains
                                the resulting size.
  @retval EFI_OUT_OF_RESOURCES  Unable to allocate sufficient
                                memory to hold the decompressed data.
  @retval EFI_UNSUPPORTED       The compression type specified
                                in the compression header is unsupported.
