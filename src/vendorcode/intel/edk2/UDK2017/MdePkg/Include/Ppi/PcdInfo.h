  Native Platform Configuration Database (PCD) INFO PPI

  The PPI that provides additional information about items that reside in the PCD database.

  Different with the EFI_GET_PCD_INFO_PPI defined in PI 1.2.1 specification,
  the native PCD INFO PPI provide interfaces for dynamic and dynamic-ex type PCD.
  The interfaces for dynamic type PCD do not require the token space guid as parameter,
  but interfaces for dynamic-ex type PCD require token space guid as parameter.
