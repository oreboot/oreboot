/**
  Executes an SMBus operation to an SMBus controller. Returns when either
  the command has been executed or an error is encountered in doing the operation.

  @param  This            A pointer to the EFI_PEI_SMBUS2_PPI instance.
  @param  SlaveAddress    The SMBUS hardware address to which the SMBUS device is preassigned or
                          allocated.
  @param  Command         This command is transmitted by the SMBus host controller to the SMBus slave
                          device and the interpretation is SMBus slave device specific.
                          It can mean the offset to a list of functions inside
                          an SMBus slave device. Not all operations or slave devices support
                          this command's registers.
  @param  Operation       Signifies which particular SMBus hardware protocol instance that it
                          will use to execute the SMBus transactions.
                          This SMBus hardware protocol is defined by the System Management Bus (SMBus)
                          Specification and is not related to UEFI.
  @param  PecCheck        Defines if Packet Error Code (PEC) checking is required for this operation.
  @param  Length          Signifies the number of bytes that this operation will do.
                          The maximum number of bytes can be revision specific and operation specific.
                          This parameter will contain the actual number of bytes that are executed
                          for this operation. Not all operations require this argument.
  @param  Buffer          Contains the value of data to execute to the SMBus slave device.
                          Not all operations require this argument.
                          The length of this buffer is identified by Length.


  @retval EFI_SUCCESS           The last data that was returned from the access
                                matched the poll exit criteria.
  @retval EFI_CRC_ERROR         The checksum is not correct (PEC is incorrect)
  @retval EFI_TIMEOUT           Timeout expired before the operation was completed.
                                Timeout is determined by the SMBus host controller device.
  @retval EFI_OUT_OF_RESOURCES  The request could not be completed
                                due to a lack of resources.
  @retval EFI_DEVICE_ERROR      The request was not completed because
                                a failure reflected in the Host Status Register bit.
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER Operation is not defined in EFI_SMBUS_OPERATION.
                                Or Length/Buffer is NULL for operations except for EfiSmbusQuickRead and
                                EfiSmbusQuickWrite. Or Length is outside the range of valid values.
  @retval EFI_UNSUPPORTED       The SMBus operation or PEC is not supported.
  @retval EFI_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL  Buffer is not sufficient for this operation.
