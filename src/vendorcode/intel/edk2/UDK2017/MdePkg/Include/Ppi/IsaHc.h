/**
  Open I/O aperture.

  This function opens an I/O aperture in a ISA Host Controller for the I/O
  addresses specified by IoAddress to IoAddress + IoLength - 1. It is possible
  that more than one caller may be assigned to the same aperture.
  It may be possible that a single hardware aperture may be used for more than
  one device. This function tracks the number of times that each aperture is
  referenced, and doesa not close the hardware aperture (via CloseIoAperture())
  until there are no more references to it.

  @param This             A pointer to this instance of the EFI_ISA_HC_PPI.
  @param IoAddress        An unsigned integer that specifies the first byte of
                          the I/O space required.
  @param IoLength         An unsigned integer that specifies the number of
                          bytes of the I/O space required.
  @param IoApertureHandle A pointer to the returned I/O aperture handle.
                          This value can be used on subsequent calls to CloseIoAperture().

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS          The I/O aperture was opened successfully.
  @retval EFI_UNSUPPORTED      The ISA Host Controller is a subtractive-decode controller.
  @retval EFI_OUT_OF_RESOURCES There is no available I/O aperture.

  Close I/O aperture.

  This function closes a previously opened I/O aperture handle. If there are no
  more I/O aperture handles that refer to the hardware I/O aperture resource,
  then the hardware I/O aperture is closed.
  It may be possible that a single hardware aperture may be used for more than
  one device. This function tracks the number of times that each aperture is
  referenced, and does not close the hardware aperture (via CloseIoAperture())
