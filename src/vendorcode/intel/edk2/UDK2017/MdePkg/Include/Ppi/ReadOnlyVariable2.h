  This service retrieves a variable's value using its name and GUID.

  Read the specified variable from the UEFI variable store. If the Data
  buffer is too small to hold the contents of the variable,
  the error EFI_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL is returned and DataSize is set to the
  required buffer size to obtain the data.

  @param  This                  A pointer to this instance of the EFI_PEI_READ_ONLY_VARIABLE2_PPI.
  @param  VariableName          A pointer to a null-terminated string that is the variable's name.
  @param  VariableGuid          A pointer to an EFI_GUID that is the variable's GUID. The combination of
                                VariableGuid and VariableName must be unique.
  @param  Attributes            If non-NULL, on return, points to the variable's attributes.
  @param  DataSize              On entry, points to the size in bytes of the Data buffer.
                                On return, points to the size of the data returned in Data.
  @param  Data                  Points to the buffer which will hold the returned variable value.
                                May be NULL with a zero DataSize in order to determine the size of the buffer needed.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS           The variable was read successfully.
  @retval EFI_NOT_FOUND         The variable was not found.
  @retval EFI_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL  The DataSize is too small for the resulting data.
                                DataSize is updated with the size required for
                                the specified variable.
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER VariableName, VariableGuid, DataSize or Data is NULL.
  @retval EFI_DEVICE_ERROR      The variable could not be retrieved because of a device error.

  Return the next variable name and GUID.

  This function is called multiple times to retrieve the VariableName
  and VariableGuid of all variables currently available in the system.
  On each call, the previous results are passed into the interface,
  and, on return, the interface returns the data for the next
  interface. When the entire variable list has been returned,
  EFI_NOT_FOUND is returned.

  @param  This              A pointer to this instance of the EFI_PEI_READ_ONLY_VARIABLE2_PPI.

  @param  VariableNameSize  On entry, points to the size of the buffer pointed to by VariableName.
                            On return, the size of the variable name buffer.
  @param  VariableName      On entry, a pointer to a null-terminated string that is the variable's name.
                            On return, points to the next variable's null-terminated name string.

  @param  VariableGuid      On entry, a pointer to an EFI_GUID that is the variable's GUID.
