  Loads a PEIM into memory for subsequent execution.

  This service is the single member function of EFI_LOAD_FILE_PPI.
  This service separates image loading and relocating from the PEI Foundation.

  @param This                   Interface pointer that implements
                                the Load File PPI instance.
  @param FileHandle             File handle of the file to load.
  @param ImageAddress           Pointer to the address of the loaded image.
  @param ImageSize              Pointer to the size of the loaded image.
  @param EntryPoint             Pointer to the entry point of the image.
  @param AuthenticationState    On exit, points to the attestation
                                authentication state of the image
                                or 0 if no attestation was performed.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS           The image was loaded successfully.
  @retval EFI_OUT_OF_RESOURCES  There was not enough memory.
  @retval EFI_LOAD_ERROR        There was no supported image in the file.
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER FileHandle was not a valid firmware file handle.
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER EntryPoint was NULL.
  @retval EFI_UNSUPPORTED       An image requires relocations or is not
                                memory mapped.
  @retval EFI_WARN_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL
                                There is not enough heap to allocate the requested size.
                                This will not prevent the XIP image from being invoked.
