/** @file
  This file declares Vector Handoff Info PPI that describes an array of
  interrupt and/or exception vectors that are in use and need to persist.

  This is an optional PPI that may be produced by SEC. If present, it provides
  a description of the interrupt and/or exception vectors that were established
  in the SEC Phase and need to persist into PEI and DXE.
