  Upon determining that there is a capsule to operate on, this service

  the current location of the various capsule fragments and coalesce them
  into a contiguous region of system memory.

  @param[in]  PeiServices   Pointer to the PEI Services Table.
  @param[out] MemoryBase    Pointer to the base of a block of memory into which the buffers will be coalesced.

                            of a coalesced capsule.
  @param[out] MemorySize    Size of the memory region pointed to by MemoryBase.
                            On output, this variable will contain the size of the
                            coalesced capsule.

  @retval EFI_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL   The capsule could not be coalesced in the provided memory region.
  @retval EFI_SUCCESS            There was no capsule, or the capsule was processed successfully.

  entries. If present, return EFI_SUCCESS, otherwise return EFI_NOT_FOUND.

  The Capsule PPI service that gets called after memory is available. The
  capsule coalesce function, which must be called first, returns a base
  address and size. Once the memory init PEIM has discovered memory,
  it should call this function and pass in the base address and size
  returned by the Coalesce() function. Then this function can create a
  capsule HOB and return.

  @par Notes:
    This function assumes it will not be called until the
    actual capsule update.
