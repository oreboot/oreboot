/**
  Provides an interface for a table based programming of the Super I/O registers.

  The Modify() function provides an interface for table based programming of the
  Super I/O registers. This function can be used to perform programming of
  multiple Super I/O registers with a single function call. For each table entry,
  the Register is read, its content is bitwise ANDed with AndMask, and then ORed
  with OrMask before being written back to the Register. The Super I/O driver
  must track the current state of the Super I/O and enable the configuration mode
  of Super I/O if necessary prior to table processing. Once the table is processed,
  the Super I/O device must be returned to the original state.
