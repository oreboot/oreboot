/**
  Return the pointer to the first instruction of a function given a function pointer.
  For Itanium processors, all function calls are made through a PLABEL, so a pointer to a function
  is actually a pointer to a PLABEL.  The pointer to the first instruction of the function
  is contained within the PLABEL.  This macro may be used to retrieve a pointer to the first
  instruction of a function independent of the CPU architecture being used.  This is very
  useful when printing function addresses through DEBUG() macros.

  @param  FunctionPointer   A pointer to a function.

  @return The pointer to the first instruction of a function given a function pointer.
