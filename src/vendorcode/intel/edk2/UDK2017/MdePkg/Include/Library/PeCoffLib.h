  Provides services to load and relocate a PE/COFF image.

  The PE/COFF Loader Library abstracts the implementation of a PE/COFF loader for
  IA-32, x86, IPF, and EBC processor types. The library functions are memory-based
  and can be ported easily to any environment.

/**
  Reads contents of a PE/COFF image.

  A function of this type reads contents of the PE/COFF image specified by FileHandle. The read
  operation copies ReadSize bytes from the PE/COFF image starting at byte offset FileOffset into
  the buffer specified by Buffer. The size of the buffer actually read is returned in ReadSize.
  If FileOffset specifies an offset past the end of the PE/COFF image, a ReadSize of 0 is returned.
  A function of this type must be registered in the ImageRead field of a PE_COFF_LOADER_IMAGE_CONTEXT
  structure for the PE/COFF Loader Library service to function correctly.  This function abstracts access
  to a PE/COFF image so it can be implemented in an environment specific manner.  For example, SEC and PEI
  environments may access memory directly to read the contents of a PE/COFF image, and DXE or UEFI
  environments may require protocol services to read the contents of PE/COFF image
  stored on FLASH, disk, or network devices.

  If FileHandle is not a valid handle, then ASSERT().
  If ReadSize is NULL, then ASSERT().
  If Buffer is NULL, then ASSERT().

  @param  FileHandle      Pointer to the file handle to read the PE/COFF image.
  @param  FileOffset      Offset into the PE/COFF image to begin the read operation.
  @param  ReadSize        On input, the size in bytes of the requested read operation.
                          On output, the number of bytes actually read.
  @param  Buffer          Output buffer that contains the data read from the PE/COFF image.

  @retval RETURN_SUCCESS            The specified portion of the PE/COFF image was
                                    read and the size return in ReadSize.
  @retval RETURN_DEVICE_ERROR       The specified portion of the PE/COFF image
                                    could not be read due to a device error.
