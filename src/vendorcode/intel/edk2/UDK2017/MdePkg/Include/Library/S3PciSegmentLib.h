/**
  Macro that converts PCI Segment, PCI Bus, PCI Device, PCI Function,
  and PCI Register to an address that can be passed to the S3 PCI Segment Library functions.

  Computes an address that is compatible with the PCI Segment Library functions.
  The unused upper bits of Segment, Bus, Device, Function,
  and Register are stripped prior to the generation of the address.

  @param  Segment   PCI Segment number.  Range 0..65535.
  @param  Bus       PCI Bus number.  Range 0..255.
  @param  Device    PCI Device number.  Range 0..31.
  @param  Function  PCI Function number.  Range 0..7.
  @param  Register  PCI Register number.  Range 0..255 for PCI.  Range 0..4095 for PCI Express.

  @return The address that is compatible with the PCI Segment Library functions.
