/** @file
  Provides services to access PCI Configuration Space.

  These functions perform PCI configuration cycles using the default PCI configuration
  access method. This may use I/O ports 0xCF8 and 0xCFC to perform PCI configuration accesses,
  or it may use MMIO registers relative to the PcdPciExpressBaseAddress, or it may use some
  alternate access method.  Modules will typically use the PCI Library for its PCI configuration
  accesses.  However, if a module requires a mix of PCI access methods, the PCI CF8 Library or
  PCI Express Library may be used in conjunction with the PCI Library.  The functionality of
  these three libraries is identical.  The PCI CF8 Library and PCI Express Library simply use
  explicit access methods.
