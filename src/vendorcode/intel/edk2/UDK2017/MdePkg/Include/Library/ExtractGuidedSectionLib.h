/** @file
  This library provides common functions to process the different guided section data.

  This library provides functions to process GUIDed sections of FFS files.  Handlers may
  be registered to decode GUIDed sections of FFS files.  Services are provided to determine
  the set of supported section GUIDs, collection information about a specific GUIDed section,
  and decode a specific GUIDed section.

  A library instance that produces this library class may be used to produce a
  EFI_PEI_GUIDED_SECTION_EXTRACTION_PPI or a EFI_GUIDED_SECTION_EXTRACTION_PROTOCOL
  providing a simple method to extend the number of GUIDed sections types a platform supports.
