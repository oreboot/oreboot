  Retrieves the architecture-specific spin lock alignment requirements for
  optimal spin lock performance.

  This function retrieves the spin lock alignment requirements for optimal
  performance on a given CPU architecture. The spin lock alignment is byte alignment.
  It must be a power of two and is returned by this function. If there are no alignment
  requirements, then 1 must be returned. The spin lock synchronization
  functions must function correctly if the spin lock size and alignment values
  returned by this function are not used at all. These values are hints to the
  consumers of the spin lock synchronization functions to obtain optimal spin
  lock performance.
