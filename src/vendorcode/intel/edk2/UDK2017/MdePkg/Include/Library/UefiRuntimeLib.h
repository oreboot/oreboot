  This service is a wrapper for the UEFI Runtime Service ResetSystem().

  The ResetSystem()function resets the entire platform, including all processors and devices,and reboots the system.
  Calling this interface with ResetType of EfiResetCold causes a system-wide reset. This sets all circuitry within
  the system to its initial state. This type of reset is asynchronous to system operation and operates without regard
  to cycle boundaries. EfiResetCold is tantamount to a system power cycle.
  Calling this interface with ResetType of EfiResetWarm causes a system-wide initialization. The processors are set to
  their initial state, and pending cycles are not corrupted. If the system does not support this reset type, then an
  EfiResetCold must be performed.
  Calling this interface with ResetType of EfiResetShutdown causes the system to enter a power state equivalent to the
  ACPI G2/S5 or G3 states. If the system does not support this reset type, then when the system is rebooted, it should
  exhibit the EfiResetCold attributes.
  The platform may optionally log the parameters from any non-normal reset that occurs.
  The ResetSystem() function does not return.

  @param  ResetType   The type of reset to perform.
  @param  ResetStatus The status code for the reset. If the system reset is part of a normal operation, the status code
                      would be EFI_SUCCESS. If the system reset is due to some type of failure the most appropriate EFI
                      Status code would be used.
  @param  DataSizeThe size, in bytes, of ResetData.
  @param  ResetData   For a ResetType of EfiResetCold, EfiResetWarm, or EfiResetShutdown the data buffer starts with a
                      Null-terminated Unicode string, optionally followed by additional binary data. The string is a

                      is only valid if ResetStatus is something other then EFI_SUCCESS. This pointer must be a physical
                      address. For a ResetType of EfiResetPlatformSpecific the data buffer also starts with a Null-terminated
                      string that is followed by an EFI_GUID that describes the specific type of reset to perform.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS           A valid capsule was passed. If CAPSULE_FLAGS_PERSIT_ACROSS_RESET is not set,
                                the capsule has been successfully processed by the firmware.
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER CapsuleSize is NULL, or an incompatible set of flags were
                                set in the capsule header.
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER CapsuleCount is 0
  @retval EFI_DEVICE_ERROR      The capsule update was started, but failed due to a device error.
  @retval EFI_UNSUPPORTED       The capsule type is not supported on this platform.
  @retval EFI_OUT_OF_RESOURCES  There were insufficient resources to process the capsule.

/**
  This service is a wrapper for the UEFI Runtime Service QueryCapsuleCapabilities().

  The QueryCapsuleCapabilities() function allows a caller to test to see if a capsule or
  capsules can be updated via UpdateCapsule(). The Flags values in the capsule header and
  size of the entire capsule is checked.
  If the caller needs to query for generic capsule capability a fake EFI_CAPSULE_HEADER can be
  constructed where CapsuleImageSize is equal to HeaderSize that is equal to sizeof
  (EFI_CAPSULE_HEADER). To determine reset requirements,
  CAPSULE_FLAGS_PERSIST_ACROSS_RESET should be set in the Flags field of the
  EFI_CAPSULE_HEADER.
  The firmware must support any capsule that has the
  CAPSULE_FLAGS_PERSIST_ACROSS_RESET flag set in EFI_CAPSULE_HEADER. The
  firmware sets the policy for what capsules are supported that do not have the
  CAPSULE_FLAGS_PERSIST_ACROSS_RESET flag set.

  @param  CapsuleHeaderArray    Virtual pointer to an array of virtual pointers to the capsules
                                being passed into update capsule. The capsules are assumed to
                                stored in contiguous virtual memory.
  @param  CapsuleCount          Number of pointers to EFI_CAPSULE_HEADER in
                                CaspuleHeaderArray.
  @param  MaximumCapsuleSize     On output the maximum size that UpdateCapsule() can
                                support as an argument to UpdateCapsule() via
                                CapsuleHeaderArray and ScatterGatherList.

  @param  ResetType             Returns the type of reset required for the capsule update.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS           A valid answer was returned.
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER MaximumCapsuleSize is NULL.
