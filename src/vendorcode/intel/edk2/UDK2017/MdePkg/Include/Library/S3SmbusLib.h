/**
  Executes an SMBUS block process call command, and saves the value in the S3 script to be replayed
  on S3 resume.

  Executes an SMBUS block process call command on the SMBUS device specified by SmBusAddress.
  The SMBUS slave address, SMBUS command, and SMBUS length fields of SmBusAddress are required.
  Bytes are written to the SMBUS from WriteBuffer.  Bytes are then read from the SMBUS into ReadBuffer.
  If Status is not NULL, then the status of the executed command is returned in Status.
  It is the caller's responsibility to make sure ReadBuffer is large enough for the total number of bytes read.
  SMBUS supports a maximum transfer size of 32 bytes, so Buffer does not need to be any larger than 32 bytes.
  If Length in SmBusAddress is zero or greater than 32, then ASSERT().
  If WriteBuffer is NULL, then ASSERT().
  If ReadBuffer is NULL, then ASSERT().
  If any reserved bits of SmBusAddress are set, then ASSERT().

  @param[in]  SmBusAddress   The address that encodes the SMBUS Slave Address,
                             SMBUS Command, SMBUS Data Length, and PEC.
  @param[in]  WriteBuffer    The pointer to the buffer of bytes to write to the SMBUS.
  @param[out] ReadBuffer     The pointer to the buffer of bytes to read from the SMBUS.
  @param[out] Status         The return status for the executed command.
                             This is an optional parameter and may be NULL.
                             RETURN_TIMEOUT A timeout occurred while executing the SMBUS command.
                             RETURN_DEVICE_ERROR  The request was not completed because a failure
                             was recorded in the Host Status Register bit.  Device errors are a result
                             of a transaction collision, illegal command field, unclaimed cycle
                             (host initiated), or bus error (collision).
                             RETURN_CRC_ERROR  The checksum is not correct (PEC is incorrect).
                             RETURN_UNSUPPORTED  The SMBus operation is not supported.

  @return   The number of bytes written.
