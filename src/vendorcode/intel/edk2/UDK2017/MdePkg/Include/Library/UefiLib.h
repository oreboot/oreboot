/** @file
  Provides library functions for common UEFI operations. Only available to DXE
  and UEFI module types.

  The UEFI Library provides functions and macros that simplify the development of
  UEFI Drivers and UEFI Applications.  These functions and macros help manage EFI
  events, build simple locks utilizing EFI Task Priority Levels (TPLs), install
  EFI Driver Model related protocols, manage Unicode string tables for UEFI Drivers,
  and print messages on the console output and standard error devices.

  Note that a reserved macro named MDEPKG_NDEBUG is introduced for the intention
  of size reduction when compiler optimization is disabled. If MDEPKG_NDEBUG is
  defined, then debug and assert related macros wrapped by it are the NULL implementations.

  Prints a formatted ASCII string to a graphics console device specified by

  This function prints a formatted ASCII string to the graphics console device
  specified by ConsoleOutputHandle in EFI_SYSTEM_TABLE and returns the number of
  ASCII characters displayed, not including partial characters that may be clipped
  by the right edge of the display.  If the length of the formatted ASCII string is
  greater than PcdUefiLibMaxPrintBufferSize, then at most the first
  PcdUefiLibMaxPrintBufferSize characters are printed.  The EFI_HII_FONT_PROTOCOL
  is used to convert the string to a bitmap using the glyphs registered with the
  HII database.  No wrapping is performed, so any portions of the string the fall
  outside the active display region will not be displayed.

  defined in the EFI_SYSTEM_TABLE then no string is printed, and 0 is returned.
