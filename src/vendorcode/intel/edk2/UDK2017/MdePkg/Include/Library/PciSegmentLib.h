/** @file
  Provides services to access PCI Configuration Space on a platform with multiple PCI segments.

  The PCI Segment Library function provide services to read, write, and modify the PCI configuration
  registers on PCI root bridges on any supported PCI segment.  These library services take a single
  address parameter that encodes the PCI Segment, PCI Bus, PCI Device, PCI Function, and PCI Register.
  The layout of this address parameter is as follows:

            PCI Register: Bits 0..11
            PCI Function  Bits 12..14
            PCI Device  Bits 15..19
            PCI Bus Bits 20..27
            Reserved  Bits 28..31.  Must be 0.
            PCI Segment Bits 32..47
            Reserved  Bits 48..63.  Must be 0.

  | Reserved (MBZ) | Segment | Reserved (MBZ) |     Bus     | Device | Function | Register |
  63             48  47    32  31           28 27         20 19    15 14      12 11         0

  These functions perform PCI configuration cycles using the default PCI configuration access
  method.  This may use I/O ports 0xCF8 and 0xCFC to perform PCI configuration accesses, or it
  may use MMIO registers relative to the PcdPciExpressBaseAddress, or it may use some alternate
  access method.  Modules will typically use the PCI Segment Library for its PCI configuration
  accesses when PCI Segments other than Segment #0 must be accessed.
