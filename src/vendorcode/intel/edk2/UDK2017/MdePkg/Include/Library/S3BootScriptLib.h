  1. Closes the specified boot script table
  2. It allocates a new memory pool to duplicate all the boot scripts in the specified table.
     Once this function is called, the table maintained by the library will be destroyed

     after using the boot script table, the CALLER is responsible for freeing the
     pool that is allocated by this function.

  API is supplied here to meet the requirements of the Framework Spec.

  If anyone does call CloseTable() on a real platform, then the caller is responsible
  for figuring out how to get the script to run on an S3 resume because the boot script
  maintained by the lib will be destroyed.
