                           that instance information is unavailable, not meaningful, or not relevant.
                           Valid instance numbers start with 1.
  @param  CallerId         This optional parameter may be used to identify the caller.
                           This parameter allows the status code driver to apply different rules to
                           different callers.
  @param  Data             This optional parameter may be used to pass additional data.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS           The function completed successfully.

  The entry point of PEI Foundation.

  This function is the entry point for the PEI Foundation, which

  temporary RAM and the Boot Firmware Volume. In addition, it also
  allows the SEC phase to pass services and data forward for use
  during the PEI phase in the form of one or more PPIs. These PPI's
  will be installed and/or immediately signaled if they are
  notification type. There is no limit to the number of additional
  PPIs that can be passed from SEC into the PEI Foundation. As part
  of its initialization phase, the PEI Foundation will add these
  SEC-hosted PPIs to its PPI database such that both the PEI
  Foundation and any modules can leverage the associated service
  calls and/or code in these early PPIs.

                        location and the BFV location.
